### [1] [LoRA-Edge: Tensor-Train-Assisted LoRA for Practical CNN Fine-Tuning on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03765)
*Hyunseok Kwak,Kyeongwon Lee,Jae-Jin Lee,Woojoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA-Edge uses TT-SVD and selective core updates to enable highly efficient on-device CNN fine-tuning for edge HAR, matching full fine-tuning accuracy with 98.5% fewer parameters and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of CNNs is infeasible on edge devices due to strict memory, compute, and energy constraints, necessitating a parameter-efficient approach for on-device adaptation to domain shifts in applications like Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

Method: LoRA-Edge applies Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional layers, selectively updates only the output-side core with zero-initialization, and fuses updates back into dense kernels without changing inference cost.

Result: LoRA-Edge achieves accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of parameters, outperforms prior PEFT baselines, and enables 1.4-3.8x faster convergence on Jetson Orin Nano.

Conclusion: LoRA-Edge makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN adaptation practical for edge platforms by significantly reducing trainable parameters while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge
applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is
infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present
LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies
Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional
layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with
zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii)
fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged.
This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of
trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full
fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves
accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of
parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines
under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and
selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1.
LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN
adaptation practical for edge platforms.

### [2] [SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03819)
*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SILVI 是一款能同时标注动物行为与交互关系的开源工具，助力自动化行为分析，也可用于人类互动视频研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源工具仅支持行为标注或个体定位，缺乏对动物交互行为的联合标注能力，阻碍了对社会行为的深入研究。

Method: 开发了一种集成行为标注与个体交互定位的开源标注软件 SILVI，支持在视频中直接标注行为和交互关系，生成结构化输出用于模型训练与验证。

Result: SILVI 实现了行为与交互的同步标注，提供了结构化数据输出，填补了动物行为分析中交互检测的工具空白。

Conclusion: SILVI 是一个开源标注工具，整合了行为标注与个体交互定位功能，推动了动物行为自动化分析的发展，并具有应用于人类交互视频的潜力。

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

### [3] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过训练时加噪声，让AI在新冠X光检测中更少依赖设备伪影，更准地识别真实病变，跨设备表现大幅提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在胸部X光片COVID-19检测中因学习到设备或群体特有的伪影而非真实生物标志物，导致在分布外数据上泛化失败。

Method: 在训练过程中应用高斯、斑点、泊松和盐椒噪声等基础噪声注入技术。

Result: 噪声注入使ID与OOD性能差距从0.10-0.20降至0.01-0.06，AUC、F1、准确率、召回率和特异性等指标平均提升显著。

Conclusion: 在训练中引入噪声注入技术可显著提升模型在分布外数据上的泛化能力，缩小与分布内数据的性能差距。

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过模拟训练的模仿学习策略能在X光引导下成功完成脊柱穿刺，表现鲁棒且可泛化，虽入口精度待提升，但为无CT机器人导航开辟新路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习在视频机器人中受关注，但其在复杂多视角X光引导手术（如脊柱器械置入）中的适用性尚不明确。

Method: 构建高保真模拟环境，采集正确轨迹与双平面X射线序列数据，训练基于视觉信息的模仿学习策略进行规划与开环控制。

Result: 策略在68.5%的首次尝试中成功维持安全椎弓根轨迹，泛化至骨折等复杂解剖结构，并在真实X光图像上产生合理轨迹。

Conclusion: 模仿学习策略在X光引导的椎弓根螺钉置入中展现出潜力，尽管在入口点精度上存在局限，但为未来无CT的机器人术中导航提供了基础。

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

### [5] [Desert Waste Detection and Classification Using Data-Based and Model-Based Enhanced YOLOv12 DL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03888)
*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级YOLOv12改进模型，专为沙漠无人机垃圾检测设计，兼顾高精度与低资源消耗，超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统垃圾收集方式在沙漠等偏远地区低效危险，现有研究多聚焦城市与可回收物，忽视有机/危险废物及非城市环境。

Method: 基于剪枝轻量化的YOLOv12，结合自对抗训练（SAT）和专用数据增强策略，在DroneTrashNet数据集上进行优化。

Result: 在精度、召回率和mAP上显著提升，同时实现低延迟与小模型尺寸，适合无人机部署，优于现有轻量级YOLO变体。

Conclusion: 结合数据中心与模型中心的增强方法，可实现沙漠环境中鲁棒、实时的垃圾检测，显著提升精度与效率。

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [6] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过图像复合技术提升不平衡医学图像数据的模型表现，实现近乎完美的诊断精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在小样本、类别不平衡及图像质量差时的高误判率问题。

Method: 通过将同一类别的多张图像融合为3x1布局的复合图像（Composite Input Images, CoImg），增强类内方差并提高训练样本的信息密度。

Result: 在OCTDL数据集上构建了平衡版本Co-OCTDL，使用VGG16模型验证，准确率达99.6%，F1-score为0.995，AUC为0.9996，远超基线模型。

Conclusion: Class-Based Image Composition显著提升了在小样本和类别不平衡数据集上的诊断性能，实现了接近完美的准确率、F1分数和AUC值。

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

### [7] [Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 用BDR和ATR实现更准、更省的时序动作定位：更锐利的边界、更低的计算开销，且兼容现有模型，性能全面超越基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对所有边界使用统一计算，忽视了边界难度的显著差异，导致效率低下与精度不足。

Method: 提出边界距离回归（BDR）进行符号距离回归替代分类，并引入自适应时间细化（ATR）实现连续深度选择以动态分配计算资源，结合知识蒸馏降低训练成本。

Result: BDR使边界峰值提升43%，mAP@0.7提升1.8%~3.1%；ATR在THUMOS14上以18%更少计算量实现56.5% mAP@0.7（提升2.9%），短动作提升达4.2%，学生模型保留99%性能。

Conclusion: 通过边界距离回归（BDR）和自适应时间细化（ATR），显著提升了时序动作定位的精度与计算效率，且在多个基准上验证了方法的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

### [8] [Improving Multi-View Reconstruction via Texture-Guided Gaussian-Mesh Joint Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03950)
*Zhejia Cai,Puhua Jiang,Shiwei Mao,Hongkun Cao,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 统一优化几何与外观，用高斯引导的可微渲染实现高质量3D重建，支持编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常分别优化几何精度或照片级渲染效果，导致几何与外观解耦，限制了下游编辑任务的性能。

Method: 通过高斯引导的可微网格渲染，同时优化网格几何（顶点位置和面）和顶点颜色，利用图像的光度一致性和法线/深度图的几何正则化。

Result: 该框架实现了高保真3D重建，能够有效支持重光照、形状变形等编辑任务。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种统一优化几何与外观的框架，实现了高质量的3D重建，并支持下游编辑任务如重光照和形状变形。

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光场相机内参标定是3D重建的关键但困难前提，现有方法难以有效解耦主透镜与MLA，影响精度与效率。

Method: 提出线性分式变换（LFT）参数α以解耦主透镜与微透镜阵列（MLA），结合最小二乘解析解与非线性优化，并引入原始图像特征检测方法。

Result: 实现了更精确的内参标定，提升了光场图像模拟速度，支持深度学习数据生成。

Conclusion: 所提方法在物理和模拟数据上均验证了有效性，并显著提升了光场图像模拟速度，有助于数据驱动的深度学习方法。

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw
light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep
learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's
website.

### [10] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Room Envelopes数据集，用低成本单目方法预测被遮挡的房间结构，实现更完整的场景重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有三维重建方法仅能恢复可见表面，忽略被遮挡的结构元素（如墙、地板、天花板），而这些元素因具有平面性、重复性和简单性，可通过低成本方法预测。

Method: 构建一个合成数据集Room Envelopes，包含RGB图像及两个点图（可见表面和移除家具后的结构布局），用于训练和评估单目几何估计模型。

Result: 所提方法能准确预测可见表面与结构布局，实现对场景整体结构的完整理解，优于仅依赖可见信息的传统方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入Room Envelopes数据集，能够有效监督单目几何估计器同时预测可见表面和结构布局，从而提升对场景范围及物体形状与位置的理解。

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

### [11] [Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988)
*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 人类靠3D姿态理解社交互动，AI缺此能力；加入简单3D面部姿态特征后，AI性能大幅提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能快速从视觉输入中识别社交互动，但AI系统仍难以胜任，推测其原因在于AI模型缺失3D姿态信息。

Method: 结合先进的姿态与深度估计算法提取视频中人物的3D关节位置，比较其与现有AI模型预测人类社交判断的能力，并构建仅含面部位置与朝向的紧凑型3D社交姿态特征。

Result: 3D关节位置优于多数AI模型；仅用面部3D位置与朝向的简化的社交姿态特征即可达到同等预测效果，并显著提升现有AI模型性能，且模型中3D姿态表征的强度与其人类判断匹配度正相关。

Conclusion: 人类社会互动判断依赖于显式的3D姿态信息，而现有AI视觉模型缺乏这种表示，引入简洁的3D社交姿态特征可显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

*Yuwen Tao,Kanglei Zhou,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaRF通过直接在3D高斯空间中建模相机几何与语言交互，实现跨视角一致的指代分割，显著提升性能并推动AR/VR与具身AI应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖2D渲染伪监督和视角特异性特征学习，导致跨视角不一致，限制了3D语义理解的可靠性。

Method: 提出Camera Aware Referring Field (CaRF)，引入高斯场相机编码（GFCE）和训练配对视角监督（ITPVS），直接在3D高斯空间中实现端到端可微分优化。

Result: 在Ref LERF、LERF OVS和3D OVS数据集上，mIoU分别平均提升16.8%、4.3%和2.0%。

Conclusion: CaRF显著提升了3D高斯点云中语言指代分割的跨视角一致性与精度，在多个基准上超越现有方法。

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

*Peiyao Wang,Weining Wang,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysCorr通过物理奖励与偏好优化，让视频生成更符合物理规律，实现真实可信的动态模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型常违反物理合理性，导致物体动力学不合理、交互不连贯、运动不真实，限制了其在具身AI、机器人和仿真领域的应用。

Method: 提出PhysicsRM双维奖励模型评估物体内部稳定性和物体间交互，并构建PhyDPO直接偏好优化管道，结合对比反馈与物理感知重加权。

Result: 在多个基准上实验表明，PhysCorr在物理真实性和视觉质量上均取得显著提升，且可无缝集成于多种视频扩散与Transformer模型。

Conclusion: PhysCorr显著提升了视频生成的物理真实性，同时保持了视觉保真度和语义对齐，推动了物理可信的视频生成发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel
direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and
physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent
outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless
integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving
visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward
physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.

*Mahmoud Soliman,Islam Osman,Mohamed S. Shehata,Rasika Rajapakshe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedDChest is a new ViT model pre-trained on massive thoracic imaging data with a smart cropping method, outperforming all prior models on medical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision models for medical imaging are hindered by fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on natural images, creating a domain gap between natural and medical imaging data.

Method: Pre-trained a Vision Transformer from scratch on 1.2M multimodal thoracic images (X-ray and CT) using a novel data augmentation technique called Guided Random Resized Crops, which biases sampling toward anatomically relevant regions.

Result: MedDChest achieves superior performance on diverse downstream diagnostic tasks compared to strong ImageNet-pretrained models, demonstrating the effectiveness of in-domain pre-training and content-aware augmentation.

Conclusion: MedDChest, a Vision Transformer pre-trained specifically for thoracic imaging, significantly outperforms ImageNet-pretrained models and serves as a superior feature extractor for thoracic diagnostic tasks.

Abstract: The performance of vision models in medical imaging is often hindered by the
prevailing paradigm of fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on out-of-domain
natural images. To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a
new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for
thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,
multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different
modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10
public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random
Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases
sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of
standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's
effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic
tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest
significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained
models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training
combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful
and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting
point for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be
made publicly available to foster future research and applications.

TL;DR: Faithful Contouring是一种高保真、稀疏、支持高分辨率的体素表示方法，无需水密化或等值面提取，显著提升3D形状表示与重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于等值面的体素表示依赖水密性或渲染优化，导致几何保真度受损，难以处理复杂几何与拓扑结构。

Method: 提出了一种无需转换为场函数或提取等值面的稀疏体素表示方法Faithful Contouring，并设计了双模式自编码器用于可扩展且保细节的形状重建。

Result: 在直接表示中距离误差达10^-5级别；在网格重建中，Chamfer距离降低93%，F分数提升35%。

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring显著优于现有方法，在表示和重建任务中均实现了更高的精度和效率。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用低帧率视频提取PPG信号，通过CWT转换为时频图，结合CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM模型实现98%的高精度生物识别，适用于移动设备安全应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG信号因其无创采集、固有的活体检测能力和适用于低成本可穿戴设备而受到关注，但受运动伪影、光照变化和个体生理差异影响，亟需鲁棒的特征提取与分类方法。

Method: 从低帧率指尖视频中提取PPG信号，经过基线漂移去除、PCA运动伪影抑制、带通滤波、傅里叶重采样和幅度归一化预处理后，使用连续小波变换（CWT）生成时频标度图，并结合CVT、ConvMixer和LSTM构建混合深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM模型在46名受试者上实现了98%的认证准确率，证明了其在噪声和个体差异下的鲁棒性，适用于移动和嵌入式生物识别安全应用。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

TL;DR: Bratrix首次实现语言锚定的视觉-脑信号对齐，通过解耦语义与不确定性感知，大幅提升神经解码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接对齐神经信号与视觉嵌入，难以捕捉潜在语义维度，导致可解释性弱和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出Bratrix框架，通过语言锚定的多模态对齐，将视觉与脑信号解耦为视觉和语言语义分量，并引入不确定性感知模块和可学习语言锚定矩阵，采用两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在多个神经影像基准上，Bratrix在检索、重建和生成描述任务中均取得SOTA性能，显著提升语义对齐效果。

Conclusion: Bratrix显著提升了脑信号与视觉语义的对齐精度，在EEG、MEG和fMRI任务中优于现有方法，尤其在200类EEG检索任务中提升14.3%。

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

Motivation: 针对CT图像去噪中缺乏配对干净数据的现实挑战，探索无需配对数据的自监督与无监督去噪方法。

Method: 采用CycleGAN残差翻译器和Noise2Score评分匹配去噪器两种数据高效范式，在统一评估协议下通过超参数调优和长时间训练进行比较。

Result: CycleGAN将PSNR从34.66 dB提升至38.913 dB，SSIM从0.9234提升至0.971；Noise2Score在极噪声输入下表现突出，虽绝对指标略低但具备良好的无配对适应性。

Conclusion: CycleGAN在CT图像去噪中提供了最强的最终图像质量，而Noise2Score在无配对数据场景下提供了一种稳健且性能竞争的替代方案。

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用位置信息，导致生成图像中对象的空间布局控制不足。

Method: 提出SpatialLock框架，包含Position-Engaged Injection (PoI)和Position-Guided Learning (PoG)两个组件，分别通过注意力机制整合空间信息和基于感知的监督优化对象定位。

Result: SpatialLock在多个数据集上实现了IOU > 0.9的精确对象定位，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SpatialLock显著提升了文本到图像生成中对象定位的精确性，实现了跨数据集IOU分数超过0.9的最先进性能。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

*Yunghee Lee,Byeonghyun Pak,Junwha Hong,Hoseong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THG speeds up diffusion sampling by 30% without retraining, using a multirate approach that treats noise and guidance differently—fine for noise, coarse for guidance—while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional diffusion solvers fail to exploit redundancy in the guidance term's sensitivity to numerical error, leading to unnecessary computational cost during sampling.

Method: Reformulating classifier-free guidance (CFG) as a multirate ODE system, where noise estimation uses fine-grained timesteps (tortoise) and guidance term uses coarse-grained timesteps (hare), combined with an error-bound-aware timestep sampler and guidance-scale scheduler.

Result: THG reduces function evaluations by up to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity (ΔImageReward ≤ 0.032), outperforming state-of-the-art training-free accelerators under identical computation budgets.

Conclusion: Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG) enables training-free acceleration of diffusion models with minimal fidelity loss, demonstrating the potential of multirate ODE formulations for real-time high-quality image synthesis.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

Conclusion: 所提框架实现了高质量的草图生成，具备精准的风格对齐和更强的风格控制灵活性。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available

TL;DR: DMSORT is a fast, robust dual-branch MOT system for maritime scenes that compensates camera motion and fuses appearance-motion cues to maintain tracking accuracy under noise and occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime environments cause camera motion and visual degradation, which severely challenge multi-object tracking accuracy and stability.

Method: A dual-branch framework with affine compensation: one branch uses RCDN and Li-TAE for robust detection and appearance feature extraction, the other estimates and compensates camera motion via projective transformation and Kalman filter, followed by clustering-optimized feature fusion.

Result: DMSORT outperforms existing methods on the Singapore Maritime Dataset, achieving the fastest runtime among ReID-based MOT frameworks without compromising accuracy or robustness.

Conclusion: DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance in maritime MOT with high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion, while being the fastest ReID-based MOT framework.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object
tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective
maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often
causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant
challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient
Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the
framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an
object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated
branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible
Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to
leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,
a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to
capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.
Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by
constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation
within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.
Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines
motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,
occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset
demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT
attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while
maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in

Conclusion: 应用颜色变换（尤其是CycleGAN）可显著提升不同模态图像间的配准精度，支持数字病理学中更可靠的分析。

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

Conclusion: 所提出的AStF方法通过引入偏度和峰度，显著提升了运动风格迁移的性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Result: MedSapiens在多个数据集上超越现有SOTA模型，平均成功检测率（SDR）最高提升21.81%；在少样本设置下仍优于现有少样本方法2.69%。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .

TL;DR: Proto-LeakNet 利用扩散模型潜在空间中的信号泄漏，实现无需重训练的高精度、可解释的深度伪造溯源，性能超越当前最优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着合成图像和深度伪造生成模型的日益复杂，源归属与真实性验证成为计算机视觉系统的关键挑战；研究发现扩散管道会无意中留下持久的统计痕迹（信号泄漏），亟需可解释且无需重训练的 Attribution 方法。

Method: 提出Proto-LeakNet，通过在扩散模型潜在域中重模拟部分前向扩散过程，利用时间注意力编码器聚合多步潜在特征，并通过特征加权原型头构建可解释的嵌入空间，实现闭集分类与基于密度的开集评估。

Conclusion: 建模扩散模型潜在空间中的信号泄漏偏差，可实现可靠且可解释的AI图像与深度伪造取证。

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

TL;DR: 利用DINOv2的语义先验学习步态特征，结合多粒度双向融合，大幅提升可见-红外视频行人重识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视步态特征的模态不变性与时间动态性，难以建模跨模态视频匹配所需的时空一致性。

Method: 提出DinoGRL框架，包含SASGL模型和PBMGE模块：SASGL利用DINOv2的语义先验增强步态轮廓，联合优化ReID目标；PBMGE通过多粒度双向交互融合步态与外观特征，提升全局与局部表征。

Result: DinoGRL有效学习互补的步态与外观特征，实现更鲁棒的序列级跨模态表征，显著提升重识别性能。

Conclusion: 所提DinoGRL框架在HITSZ-VCM和BUPT数据集上显著超越现有SOTA方法，验证了其在跨模态视频行人重识别中的优越性。

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS加速方法在训练中无法有效调控高斯数量，导致计算开销冗余。

Method: 基于多视图一致性设计密度增强与剪枝策略，摒弃预算机制。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360上实现3.32倍加速，在Deep Blending上达15.45倍加速，跨任务提升2-7倍训练速度。

Conclusion: FastGS显著提升3D高斯泼溅的训练速度，同时保持渲染质量，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface
reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and
simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at

TL;DR: 通过自监督预训练打造农业专用视觉模型，大幅超越通用模型，在少标注、跨场景下实现更高精度与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用视觉模型在农业场景中因物种和损伤类型的细粒度区分困难而性能受限，亟需专用于除草剂试验的优化模型。

Method: 基于大规模农业数据集的自监督学习，对通用视觉基础模型进行领域适配与预训练。

Result: 物种识别F1从0.91提升至0.94，损伤分类从0.26提升至0.33；在未见条件下提升更显著，且在低标注场景下以80%更少样本实现5.4%更高F1分数。

Conclusion: 领域特定的视觉基础模型在除草剂试验分析中显著优于通用模型，具备更强的泛化能力和标注效率，为自动化农业分析提供了可扩展方案。

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

TL;DR: 利用合成数据增强YOLOv10模型，实现全球离岸设施高精度检测，F1分数提升至0.90，验证了跨区域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离岸设施检测因样本稀缺、类别不平衡而受限，亟需提升模型泛化能力以实现全球监测。

Method: 使用YOLOv10模型，结合真实Sentinel-1卫星图像与合成数据，在四个区域训练，并在三个未见区域进行地理外推评估。

Result: 模型在未见区域检测到3,529个离岸平台，F1分数从0.85提升至0.90，证明合成数据有效改善不平衡类别的表征与整体性能。

Conclusion: 合成数据显著提升了YOLOv10模型对离岸基础设施的检测性能，验证了其在全球范围内的可迁移性，为大规模遥感监测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

TL;DR: RISE-T2V通过一个创新的重述适配器，将提示改写与语义提取一体化，大幅提升文本到视频生成的意图匹配能力与视频质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频扩散模型依赖预训练文本编码器，对简短提示理解有限，且无法在线重述提示以更好匹配用户意图，限制了模型的可扩展性与可用性。

Method: 提出Rephrasing Adapter模块，将提示重述与语义特征提取整合为单一步骤，利用LLM的隐藏状态作为视频生成的条件。

Result: RISE-T2V在多种视频扩散模型上验证有效，显著提升生成视频的质量与意图一致性，支持更广泛的文本到视频任务。

Conclusion: RISE-T2V显著提升了文本到视频生成模型在用户意图对齐和视频质量方面的性能，是一个适用于多种模型架构的通用框架。

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEVFusion在遮挡下更依赖LiDAR，相机遮挡影响较小，但LiDAR遮挡显著降低性能，亟需增强鲁棒性融合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管BEV表示在多模态融合中表现优异，但环境遮挡（如雾、霾或物理遮挡）对传感器输出及检测精度的影响尚未被充分研究。

Method: 基于BEVFusion架构，在nuScenes数据集上通过模拟相机和LiDAR的遮挡情况，评估其对3D目标检测性能的影响，使用mAP和NDS作为评价指标。

Result: 相机中等遮挡导致仅相机检测mAP下降41.3%；LiDAR在严重遮挡下mAP下降47.3%，尤其影响远距离检测；融合场景中，遮挡相机仅使mAP下降4.1%，而遮挡LiDAR则下降26.8%，表明模型更依赖LiDAR。

Conclusion: 未来研究需要关注遮挡感知的评估方法和改进的传感器融合技术，以在传感器部分失效或环境退化时维持检测精度。

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial
steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.

Conclusion: HideAndSeg 提供了一种高效、自动化的方法来分割野外章鱼视频，显著减少了人工干预，推动了头足类动物行为研究的进展。

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark
dataset of such puzzles.

Conclusion: V-Thinker显著提升了大多模态模型在视觉交互推理任务中的性能，提供了推进图像交互推理应用的重要洞见。

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在跨传感器、跨区域或训练数据有限时表现不佳，亟需更通用和鲁棒的滑坡映射方法。

Method: 基于全球预训练、自监督学习和可适应微调的三轴分析框架（传感器、标签、领域），使用Prithvi-EO-2.0模型进行滑坡制图。

Result: Prithvi-EO-2.0在多种传感器和地理环境下均优于U-Net、Segformer等传统模型及其他GeoFMs，表现出对光谱变化的鲁棒性、低标签稀缺下的高精度和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GeoFMs，特别是Prithvi-EO-2.0，为滑坡风险降低和环境监测提供了更稳健和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出一个高效、细粒度的说话头视频评估框架，揭示当前模型在表情和细节上的不足，并发布大规模数据集与公开基准，推动领域进步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前说话头生成的评估依赖有限指标（如视频质量、唇同步和用户研究），无法全面反映生成效果，亟需更系统、细粒度、高效的评估体系。

Method: 构建一个包含8个高效且与人类偏好对齐的评估指标，聚焦头部、嘴巴、眉毛的细粒度动态及面部质量，并基于自建的85,000个视频的无偏真实数据集进行大规模实验，覆盖17个SOTA模型。

Result: 实验表明多数模型在唇同步表现良好，但在表情自然性和细节真实性上存在明显缺陷；所提框架能有效区分模型性能差异，为领域发展提供可靠基准。

Conclusion: 现有视频生成评估指标不足，本文提出一个基于质量、自然性和同步性三个维度的8指标新评估框架，能更精准反映生成视频的细粒度表现，尤其揭示了当前模型在表情丰富性和无伪影细节上的短板。

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

TL;DR: STC-Net首次实现从完整腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中自动评估手术复杂性，基于PGS量表，在弱监督下显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腹腔镜胆囊切除术中炎症严重程度与手术时间和术后并发症风险密切相关，但现有方法多依赖静态图像或人工剪辑片段，缺乏对完整视频的自动化分析能力。

Method: 提出STC-Net框架，基于单时间戳的弱时间监督，结合定位、窗口提议和分级模块，采用融合硬与软定位目标及背景感知分级监督的新型损失函数，直接处理完整手术视频。

Result: 在1,859个私有LC视频数据集上，STC-Net达到62.11%的准确率和61.42%的F1分数，比非定位基线方法提升超10%。

Conclusion: STC-Net提供了一种可扩展且有效的自动化方法，基于Parkland分级量表（PGS）从完整腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中评估手术复杂性，适用于术后分析和手术培训。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.

TL;DR: UniSplat uses a 3D latent scaffold and dynamic Gaussians to achieve cutting-edge 3D reconstruction from sparse, non-overlapping camera views in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods struggle with sparse, non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics in autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: UniSplat constructs a 3D latent scaffold using pretrained foundation models, employs an efficient fusion mechanism within the scaffold for spatio-temporal alignment, and uses a dual-branch decoder to generate dynamic-aware Gaussians with persistent static Gaussian memory.

Result: UniSplat delivers superior novel view synthesis and streaming scene completion beyond camera coverage, outperforming prior methods on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: UniSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and enables robust, high-quality rendering for unseen viewpoints by leveraging unified latent spatio-temporal fusion.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,
yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,
non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

TL;DR: PixCLIP通过LLM替代CLIP文本编码器+长文本标注+三分支对齐，实现图像与文本的细粒度协同理解，性能超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的文本编码器受token长度限制，难以处理长文本，而现有方法仅提升视觉粒度，缺乏图文细粒度协同优化。

Method: 构建自动化标注管道生成像素级长文本描述，替换CLIP文本编码器为LLM，并提出三分支像素-文本对齐学习框架。

Result: 构建了包含150万样本的LongGRIT数据集，PixCLIP在像素级交互和长文本处理上实现突破，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: PixCLIP通过结合视觉提示和长文本描述，实现了图像区域与文本描述的细粒度对齐，取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出基于染色精度的自动化评估框架，证明传统图像指标无效，指出配对模型更优，并强调全切片评估的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于纹理和分布的图像质量评估指标仅衡量图像保真度，而非IHC染色的准确性，无法真实反映模型在临床应用中的表现。

Method: 使用颜色去卷积生成IHC阳性像素的掩膜，并基于真实与虚拟IHC掩膜计算Dice、IoU、Hausdorff距离等染色准确性指标，避免依赖专家人工标注。

Result: 传统图像保真度指标（如FID、PSNR、SSIM）与染色准确性和病理学家评估相关性低；配对模型（如PyramidPix2Pix、AdaptiveNCE）表现最优，非配对模型可靠性较差，且全切片图像评估揭示了补丁评估中不可见的性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估虚拟IHC模型质量提供了一种可重复的方法，是推动其在病理学家日常使用中转化的关键步骤。

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法受限于对参考视频的依赖或高昂的人类评分数据需求，且多数无参考方法为图像级，忽略视频关键的时间上下文信息。

Method: 利用DAVIS数据集的合成退化视频，训练一个时序感知的卷积架构，直接预测全参考指标（LPIPS、PSNR、SSIM），推理时无需参考视频。

Result: 所提模型在多样退化下优于图像基线，且相关性高于BRISQUE，验证了时序建模在无参考、无评分场景下的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种可扩展的、流式无参考视频质量评估模型，无需人类评分或参考视频，通过时间建模显著提升了对多种退化类型的泛化能力，并在相关性上优于传统图像质量评估方法。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

TL;DR: Polarization-based eye tracking outperforms intensity-only methods by revealing hidden ocular features, cutting gaze error by up to 16%, and enabling more robust wearable eye-tracking systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional intensity-only eye tracking is limited by occlusions, gaze-informative feature absence, and environmental variations; polarization contrast offers a more reliable alternative.

Method: A polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system using a polarization-filter-array camera and linearly polarized near-infrared illuminator, combined with convolutional neural network-based machine learning models.

Result: PET reduced the median 95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10–16% compared to intensity-only baselines across 346 participants, even under challenging conditions like eyelid occlusion and pupil-size variation.

Conclusion: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging significantly improves eye tracking accuracy and robustness, making it a promising modality for wearable devices.

Abstract: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging adds a useful optical contrast
mechanism to eye tracking by measuring the polarization state of light
reflected by ocular tissues in addition to its intensity. In this paper we
demonstrate how this contrast can be used to enable eye tracking. Specifically,
we demonstrate that a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system composed
of a polarization--filter--array camera paired with a linearly polarized
near-infrared illuminator can reveal trackable features across the sclera and
gaze-informative patterns on the cornea, largely absent in intensity-only
images. Across a cohort of 346 participants, convolutional neural network based
machine learning models trained on data from PET reduced the median
95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10--16\% relative to capacity-matched
intensity baselines under nominal conditions and in the presence of eyelid
occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation. These results link
light--tissue polarization effects to practical gains in human--computer
interaction and position PET as a simple, robust sensing modality for future
wearable devices.

<details>

Motivation: 当前多模态基准易被模型利用语言先验和非视觉模式通过，而非真正理解视觉内容，导致评估失效。

Method: 采用测试集压力测试（TsT）对非视觉文本输入进行k折交叉验证以检测偏差，并结合随机森林特征分析进行快速审计；通过迭代偏差修剪（IBP）过滤高偏差样本。

Result: 在VSI-Bench、CV-Bench、MMMU和VideoMME四个基准上发现广泛存在的非视觉偏差，并成功构建去偏差版本VSI-Bench-Debiased，显著降低非视觉可解性并扩大视觉盲区性能差距。

Conclusion: 通过提出测试集压力测试（TsT）和迭代偏差修剪（IBP）方法，可有效识别并缓解多模态基准中的非视觉偏差，提升基准的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

Method: 提出SIMS-V框架，利用3D模拟器生成带有精确空间标注的视频数据，并通过系统性消融实验确定最有效的三类空间问题类型。

Result: 仅用25K模拟样本微调7B模型，即超越72B基线，并在真实世界空间推理基准上达到与专有模型相当的性能，同时保持通用视频理解能力。

Conclusion: 使用3D模拟器生成的少量高质量空间数据可显著提升多模态语言模型在真实世界空间推理任务上的性能，甚至超越更大参数的基线模型。

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

TL;DR: True multimodal intelligence needs more than scale—models must anticipate and organize experience through predictive sensing, as shown by a new benchmark and method that outperform current systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal systems are limited to reactive, task-driven approaches and brute-force context scaling, failing to capture true spatial cognition and world modeling.

Method: Proposed VSI-SUPER benchmark (VSR and VSC tasks) and a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leveraging prediction error to drive memory and segmentation.

Result: Cambrian-S achieved +30% improvement on VSI-Bench with VSI-590K data, but performance on VSI-SUPER remained low; the predictive sensing approach outperformed proprietary baselines on VSI-SUPER.

Conclusion: Scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing; predictive sensing with surprise-driven memory and event segmentation is a promising path forward.

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在质量与效率之间难以平衡，扩散模型虽质量高但速度慢，而自回归模型在高分辨率视频生成上能力有限，亟需高效且高质量的统一生成框架。

Method: 提出一种统一的时空自回归框架，通过纯离散方式联合建模空间与时间依赖关系，支持文本到图像、文本到视频、图像到视频等多种生成任务。

Conclusion: InfinityStar是首个能够生成工业级720p视频的离散自回归视频生成模型，在VBench上以83.74分超越所有自回归模型，甚至优于部分扩散模型，且生成速度提升约10倍。

Abstract: We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for
high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent
success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely
discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a
single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of
generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long
interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench,
outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some
diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model
generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading
diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete
autoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p
videos. We release all code and models to foster further research in efficient,

TL;DR: TubeletGraph tracks objects through state changes by building a state graph, outperforming existing methods on a new benchmark for transformation-aware tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to track objects after significant appearance changes during state transformations, necessitating a system that can detect and describe such changes.

Method: TubeletGraph is a zero-shot system that identifies overlooked tracks, integrates them using semantic and proximity priors, and constructs a state graph to model transformation evolution.

Result: TubeletGraph successfully recovers missing objects post-transformation and generates detailed state graphs, outperforming prior methods on the new VOST-TAS benchmark.

Conclusion: TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance under object transformations and demonstrates strong capabilities in temporal grounding and semantic reasoning.

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at

Motivation: Modern social media applications require multiple distinct, aesthetically pleasing crops from a single image, a problem largely unaddressed by prior work.

Method: The authors use an image partitioning algorithm as a pre-processing step to adapt existing single-crop models for generating multiple crops, evaluated on a newly introduced dataset.

Result: A dataset of 277 images with human-labeled preferred crops is introduced, and several single-crop models show improved performance when combined with partitioning.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that applying image partitioning as a pre-processing step can improve the efficacy of single-crop models for generating multiple aesthetically appealing crops.

Abstract: Automatic image cropping is a method for maximizing the human-perceived
quality of cropped regions in photographs. Although several works have proposed
techniques for producing singular crops, little work has addressed the problem
of producing multiple, distinct crops with aesthetic appeal. In this paper, we
motivate the problem with a discussion on modern social media applications,
introduce a dataset of 277 relevant images and human labels, and evaluate the
efficacy of several single-crop models with an image partitioning algorithm as
a pre-processing step. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 通过大五人格理论与低秩子空间分析，实现对LLM人格特质的精准引导，无需牺牲生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的行为控制存在关键空白，人格感知LLM虽具潜力，但其心理构念与模型表征的关系尚未深入探索，亟需研究如何利用这些表征引导模型行为。

Method: 基于大五人格特质（开放性、尽责性、外向性、宜人性、神经质）提取Transformer层的隐藏状态激活，采用低秩子空间发现方法，识别各模型架构中的最优层进行鲁棒注入，并通过动态层选择的灵活引导框架实现精准控制。

Result: 成功提取出与大五人格相关的低秩引导方向，实现了对LLM输出中人格特质的精确调控，验证了其在不损害语言能力前提下的有效性。

Conclusion: 人格特质在LLM中占据低秩共享子空间，可通过精细扰动实现有效引导，而不影响生成流畅性与通用能力，弥合了心理理论与模型对齐之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit implicit personalities in their generation, but
reliably controlling or aligning these traits to meet specific needs remains an
open challenge. The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation
of the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs
to be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this
objective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and
their representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further
investigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of
these representations to steer the models' behaviour. We propose a novel
pipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using
the Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness and Neuroticism), which is a comprehensive and empirically
validated framework to model human personality applies low-rank subspace
discovery methods, and identifies trait-specific optimal layers across
different model architectures for robust injection. The resulting
personality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible
steering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of
trait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits
occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be
transformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful
perturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities,
helping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model
alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TextualVerifier通过LLM链式推理与投票机制，首次实现TextGrad的自验证，显著提升文本优化可靠性，无需数值梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TextGrad缺乏自验证机制，导致文本决策推理的有效性无法保障，亟需一种无需数值梯度的验证方法。

Method: 采用链式思维分解、变体生成、多数投票和共识聚合的四阶段工作流，非侵入式集成至TextGrad的损失函数与优化结果验证阶段。

Result: 在PRM800K上推理步骤有效性提升29%；集成至TextGrad后，在GPQA-Diamond等基准上准确率提升2.2个百分点，平均仅增加5.9次LLM调用，版本迭代进一步提升3.92–10.71个百分点。

Conclusion: TextualVerifier是首个基于LLM的TextGrad自验证框架，无需数值梯度即可提升文本优化的推理可靠性，开辟了文本优化验证的新方向。

Abstract: TextGrad is a novel approach to text-based automatic differentiation that
enables composite AI systems to perform optimization without explicit numerical
equations. However, it currently lacks self-verification mechanisms that ensure
reasoning validity in text-based decision making. This research introduces
TextualVerifier, a verification framework that leverages chain-of-thought
reasoning and majority voting with large language models to address this
verification gap. TextualVerifier implements a four-stage workflow:
chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and
consensus aggregation. It integrates non-invasively with TextGrad at both the
loss function and optimization result verification stages. Experimental
evaluation using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is conducted in two phases: (1)
standalone evaluation on PRM800K, and (2) integrated evaluation with TextGrad
on GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP benchmarks. Results show statistically
significant improvements (p < 0.001). In phase one, TextualVerifier improves
the validity of reasoning steps by 29 percent. In phase two, integration into
TextGrad loss function yields a 2.2 percentage point gain from 68.2 to 70.4
percent with a moderate overhead of 5.9 LLM calls on average. Further
evaluations of TextualVerifier versioning yield 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92
percentage point improvements on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively.
TextualVerifier thus presents the first self-verification framework for
TextGrad through LLM-based techniques without requiring numerical gradients,
enabling more reliable reasoning and opening new directions for verification in
text-based optimization.

Conclusion: PLLuM 是首个面向波兰语的大规模开源语言模型家族，显著提升了波兰语在AI领域的技术支持与文化相关性，并推动了波兰主权AI的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a central role in modern artificial
intelligence, yet their development has been primarily focused on English,
resulting in limited support for other languages. We present PLLuM (Polish
Large Language Model), the largest open-source family of foundation models
tailored specifically for the Polish language. Developed by a consortium of
major Polish research institutions, PLLuM addresses the need for high-quality,
transparent, and culturally relevant language models beyond the English-centric
commercial landscape. We describe the development process, including the
construction of a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus for pre-training, a
77k custom instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. A
key component is a Responsible AI framework that incorporates strict data
governance and a hybrid module for output correction and safety filtering. We
detail the models' architecture, training procedures, and alignment techniques
for both base and instruction-tuned variants, and demonstrate their utility in
a downstream task within public administration. By releasing these models
publicly, PLLuM aims to foster open research and strengthen sovereign AI
technologies in Poland.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如微调计算成本高，而推理时方法如Best-of-N需不切实际的计算量，亟需更高效对齐方案。

Method: STARS：分段标记对齐与拒绝采样，通过迭代采样、评分和接受/拒绝短固定长度标记段来引导生成。

Result: 在六个LLM上，STARS比SFT最高提升14.9个百分点，比DPO提升4.3个百分点，性能接近Best-of-N但计算效率更高。

Conclusion: STARS是一种高效且鲁棒的LLM对齐方法，优于传统微调和全序列排序方法。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human values is crucial for their safe
deployment; however, existing methods, such as fine-tuning, are computationally
expensive and suboptimal. In contrast, inference-time approaches like Best-of-N
sampling require practically infeasible computation to achieve optimal
alignment. We propose STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection
Sampling, a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively
sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments.
This allows for early correction of the generation path, significantly
improving computational efficiency and boosting alignment quality. Across a
suite of six LLMs, we show that STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up
to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining highly competitive with
strong Best-of-N baselines. Our work establishes granular, reward-guided
sampling as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional
fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM在多标签分类中一次性生成所有标签效率低下，需在不损失准确率的前提下提升短文本推理速度。

Method: 将分类任务重构为一系列独立的二元（是/否）查询，结合前缀缓存机制提升推理效率，并使用LLM-to-SLM蒸馏生成标注数据以微调小型模型。

Result: 所提方法在24个情感维度上显著优于零样本基线，微调后小型模型在训练维度上表现突出，且推理效率大幅提高。

Conclusion: 将多标签分类分解为二元决策序列，结合蒸馏与缓存感知推理，可构建高效且可扩展的LLM分类框架。

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with
large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as
sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions. Instead of generating all labels in
a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently,
which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency
gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy. To demonstrate the
approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including
emotions and sentiment. Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator
model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are
aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B,
Gemma3-1B). The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot
baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training. Our findings
suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries,
combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and
effective framework for LLM-based classification. While we validate the method
on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.

Motivation: 当前低资源语言NLP研究过度追求数据规模，忽视数据质量，可能导致技术性能差并加剧社会偏见。

Method: 分析阿法尔奥罗莫语、阿姆哈拉语和提格雷尼亚语的机器翻译数据集，评估其领域分布与性别表征偏差。

Result: 数据集中政治与宗教文本占比高，基准数据集中新闻、健康与体育占主导；男性性别表征显著偏高，女性遭受有害与刻板印象描述，且数据量最大的语言问题最严重。

Conclusion: 高质量数据集的缺失和性别偏见在低资源语言的机器翻译数据中普遍存在，且数据量大并不保证质量，需尽早干预有害内容。

Abstract: As low-resourced languages are increasingly incorporated into NLP research,
there is an emphasis on collecting large-scale datasets. But in prioritizing
quantity over quality, we risk 1) building language technologies that perform
poorly for these languages and 2) producing harmful content that perpetuates
societal biases. In this paper, we investigate the quality of Machine
Translation (MT) datasets for three low-resourced languages--Afan Oromo,
Amharic, and Tigrinya, with a focus on the gender representation in the
datasets. Our findings demonstrate that while training data has a large
representation of political and religious domain text, benchmark datasets are
focused on news, health, and sports. We also found a large skew towards the
male gender--in names of persons, the grammatical gender of verbs, and in
stereotypical depictions in the datasets. Further, we found harmful and toxic
depictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the
largest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality.
We hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for
low-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content.

*Manh Nguyen,Sunil Gupta,Dai Do,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAD reduces LLM hallucinations by adaptively fusing corpus-derived token transition evidence during decoding, achieving state-of-the-art factuality without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination mitigation methods rely on fragile prompt-based grounding or costly symbolic knowledge integration; GRAD aims to provide a lightweight, retrieval-free, and retraining-free alternative using statistical evidence from token transitions.

Method: GRAD constructs a sparse token transition graph from next-token logits of a retrieved corpus in a single forward pass, then adaptively fuses graph-retrieved logits with model logits during decoding using max-normalization.

Result: GRAD achieves up to 9.7% higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6% lower hallucination rates, and 6.9% greater correctness than greedy decoding, while attaining the highest truth-informativeness product score.

Conclusion: Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD) effectively reduces hallucinations in LLMs by leveraging corpus-derived token transition graphs without retraining, outperforming baselines in accuracy, factuality, and truth-informativeness.

Abstract: Hallucination mitigation remains a persistent challenge for large language
models (LLMs), even as model scales grow. Existing approaches often rely on
external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs,
accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is
fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy
retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce
Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds
generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a
sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small
retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved
logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor
high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a
range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic
hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,
achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination
rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while
attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.
GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding
and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from
corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more
truthful and verifiable outputs.

Motivation: 评估机器学习模型在多轮语言环境中进行上下文敏感语用推理的能力。

Method: 通过改变上下文的数量、顺序和相关性，测试人类与视觉语言模型在迭代指称游戏中的表现。

Result: 无相关上下文时模型表现优于随机但远逊于人类；有相关上下文时模型表现随试验显著提升；抽象指称的少样本任务仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在迭代指称游戏中，缺乏相关上下文时表现远低于人类，但在有相关上下文时表现显著提升，表明其对上下文敏感的语用推理能力仍有限。

Abstract: Iterated reference games - in which players repeatedly pick out novel
referents using language - present a test case for agents' ability to perform
context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments. We
tested humans and vision-language models on trials from iterated reference
games, varying the given context in terms of amount, order, and relevance.
Without relevant context, models were above chance but substantially worse than
humans. However, with relevant context, model performance increased
dramatically over trials. Few-shot reference games with abstract referents
remain a difficult task for machine learning models.

large language models to classify expressions across 48 indicators aligned with
Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework plus attitudes towards migration
and perception of corruption. The dataset offers monthly and yearly county- and

Motivation: 现有多智能体系统中LLM以纯令牌传递信息，丢失潜在语义，导致信息传输受限且计算开销增加。

Method: 通过训练双编码器翻译器在Llama-2-7B和Mistral-7B-Instruct之间进行向量翻译，并以30%混合强度注入目标模型以引导生成。

Result: 翻译器实现平均余弦对齐0.538，双向评估显示2.01:1的转移不对称性，通用模型比指令微调模型具有更强的可转移表示。

Conclusion: 跨模型潜在通信是可行的，能够实现AI系统间语义共享而非仅传递令牌。

Abstract: In multi-agent settings, such as debate, reflection, or tool-calling, large
language models (LLMs) pass messages as plain tokens, discarding most latent
semantics. This constrains information transfer and adds unnecessary
computational overhead. We form a latent bridge via vector translations, which
use learned mappings that enable direct semantic exchange between
representation spaces. A dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and
Mistral-7B-Instruct attains an average cosine alignment of 0.538. Injecting the
translated vectors at 30 percent blending strength steers the target model's
generation without destabilizing logits. Bidirectional evaluation shows a
2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, indicating that general-purpose models yield more
transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants. This conservative
injection preserves computational stability while demonstrating that
cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems
that share meaning rather than tokens.

Result: 在溯因推理和多跳QA基准上，准确率与推理可信度均得到提升

Conclusion: 引入溯因推理能显著提升RAG系统的鲁棒性与可解释性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance
in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved
evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process. In such cases,
\emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing
premises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge
these gaps. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive
inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our method detects insufficient
evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through
consistency and plausibility checks. Experimental results on abductive
reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both
answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness. This work highlights abductive
inference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and
explainability of RAG systems.

Motivation: 当前评估方法仅关注解释的合理性或内部一致性，未能反映其是否符合领域专家的实际推理方式，尤其在医疗、天文、心理等专业场景中存在明显不足。

Method: 与领域专家合作，构建了覆盖七个知识密集型领域的 T-FIX 基准，并开发了新的评估指标来衡量模型解释与专家判断的对齐程度。

Result: 提出了 T-FIX 基准和配套指标，首次系统性地量化了 LLM 解释与专家直觉的对齐程度。

Conclusion: T-FIX 提出了一种新的评估标准，用于衡量大语言模型解释与领域专家直觉的一致性，超越了传统对解释合理性的关注。

Abstract: As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM能模仿人类部分联想，但更机械、情绪更强、更少创意。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类联想受个人经验与认知风格影响，是探索心理词典与创造力的关键，但其不可预测性限制了建模；本研究旨在检验大型语言模型是否能模拟人类的创造性联想。

Method: 比较人类与大型语言模型对情感负载词的自由联想反应，分析其关联模式的相似性与差异性。

Result: LLM的联想比人类更一致、情绪放大更明显，但创造性与多样性显著低于人类。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型的联想行为与人类有中等程度的重叠，但更可预测、创造性更低，且倾向于放大情绪负荷。

Abstract: Human word associations are a well-known method of gaining insight into the
internal mental lexicon, but the responses spontaneously offered by human
participants to word cues are not always predictable as they may be influenced
by personal experience, emotions or individual cognitive styles. The ability to
form associative links between seemingly unrelated concepts can be the driving
mechanisms of creativity. We perform a comparison of the associative behaviour
of humans compared to large language models. More specifically, we explore
associations to emotionally loaded words and try to determine whether large
language models generate associations in a similar way to humans. We find that
the overlap between humans and LLMs is moderate, but also that the associations
of LLMs tend to amplify the underlying emotional load of the stimulus, and that
they tend to be more predictable and less creative than human ones.

TL;DR: 通过大规模多模态训练的Transformer模型，在放射学报告PHI去标识化任务中表现卓越，超越商业系统，实现高精度与强泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升放射学报告自动化去标识化的准确性与泛化能力，克服现有商业系统性能不足的问题，同时确保隐私保护与数据效用的平衡。

Method: 基于Transformer的PHI去标识化流程，通过斯坦福大学两个大型标注放射学语料库进行微调，引入新的PHI类别（AGE），并在斯坦福和宾夕法尼亚大学的测试集上评估性能，同时与商业系统对比，并评估合成PHI的稳定性。

Result: 模型在宾夕法尼亚大学数据集上F1为0.973，在斯坦福数据集上达0.996；合成PHI检测F1为0.959，显著优于商业系统（0.632-0.754）。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在多样化的放射学数据集上训练后，在PHI检测中超越了以往的学术和商业系统，建立了安全临床文本处理的新基准。

Abstract: Objective: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by
scaling transformer-based models through extensive training datasets and
benchmarking performance against commercial cloud vendor systems for protected
health information (PHI) detection. Materials and Methods: In this
retrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI
de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology
corpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,
abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI
category (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test
sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level
PHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI
generation using a "hide-in-plain-sight" method and (2) performance against
commercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all
PHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the
Penn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining
the previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation
showed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50
independently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor
systems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).
Discussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional
generalization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility
while ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model
trained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial
systems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical
text processing.

### [70] [A Characterization of List Language Identification in the Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04103)
*Moses Charikar,Chirag Pabbaraju,Ambuj Tewari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过允许每次输出k个猜测，突破了经典语言识别的局限，给出了可识别性的分解刻画，并证明了统计环境下的最优指数收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受语言生成问题的积极结果启发，重新审视经典语言识别问题，引入k-列表猜测机制以突破Gold的不可能性结果。

Method: 基于Angluin的经典识别条件，提出递归版本的刻画，并结合分解方法和统计速率分析。

Result: 给出了k-列表识别的精确充要条件，并证明了在统计设置下指数速率的最优性及不可识别集合的速率下界。

Conclusion: 一个语言集合可以被k-列表在极限下识别，当且仅当它可以分解为k个子集合，每个子集合都能以单列表在极限下识别；且在统计设置下，可识别的集合能达到指数速率，不可识别的则无法以任何趋近于零的速率识别。

Abstract: We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a
sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to
output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses
beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that
language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any
interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise
characterization of language collections for which this task is possible.
Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language
generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the
setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of
$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite
time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be
$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's
characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This
further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language
collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the
collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which
can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our
characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical
setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution
supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a
collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be
$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the
other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it
cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 批处理让大模型推理更高效、更果断，还能让模型从同批样本中学习泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作关注批处理降低推理成本，但忽略了其在多步推理中对模型行为的正则化作用。

Method: 在13个多样化基准上进行综合实验，结合行为分析研究批处理对模型推理的影响。

Result: 批处理提升准确率，减少3-5倍推理token使用，抑制过度思考和犹豫语言，并激发批次内样本间的集体泛化效应。

Conclusion: 批处理不仅是一种吞吐量优化手段，更是一种强大的推理时正则化方法，能提升大语言模型推理的效率与可靠性。

Abstract: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference
cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching
offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior
during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a
comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching
improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by
3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses
overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and
encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent
collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from
earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings
position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful
inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: RIDE用IRT和强化学习生成高质量对抗题，揭露出大模型数学推理的脆弱性，性能平均下降21.73%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则的扰动方法生成的问题质量差，难以系统评估问题难度和基准演进，需更严谨的评估框架。

Method: 基于项目反应理论（IRT）构建难度排序器，利用强化学习指导问题重写模型生成不同难度级别的对抗性问题。

Result: 在26个先进模型上平均性能下降21.73%，证明RIDE能有效暴露模型推理的不足。

Conclusion: RIDE通过对抗性重写数学问题，有效揭示了大语言模型在数学推理中的脆弱性，验证了评估方法的合理性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance on mathematical
reasoning, but these results can be inflated by training data leakage or
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. To this end, an
adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true
mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often
generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question
difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item
Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate
intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems.
We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their
responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning
and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across
difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks
yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with
experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing
limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our
evaluation approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CantoASR通过声学与大语言模型协同校正，大幅提升低资源粤语语音识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粤语作为低资源语言，受限于标注数据少、六声调、变调及口音变异，现有模型如Whisper词错误率高，需更有效利用声学与语义线索。

Method: 引入CantoASR框架，结合强制对齐提取声学特征、LoRA微调的Whisper提升声调判别、指令微调的Qwen-Audio实现韵律感知校正。

Result: 在自发粤语数据上，CantoASR相较Whisper-Large-V3显著降低了字符错误率（CER）。

Conclusion: 整合声学线索与大音频语言模型推理为低资源声调和方言语音识别提供了可扩展策略。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for language accessibility,
yet low-resource Cantonese remains challenging due to limited annotated data,
six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. Existing ASR models, such
as Whisper, often suffer from high word error rates. Large audio-language
models (LALMs), in contrast, can leverage broader contextual reasoning but
still require explicit tonal and prosodic acoustic cues. We introduce CantoASR,
a collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that integrates forced
alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for
improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for
prosody-aware correction. Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show
substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3. These findings suggest that
integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for
low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

TL;DR: 通过多智能体协作提升小模型SQL生成能力，Reasoner-Coder管道最优，显著超越单模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型在复杂模式和推理任务中表现不佳，而小模型被忽视，亟需高效、实用的轻量级SQL生成方法。

Method: 设计并对比三种多智能体LLM管道：讨论型、规划-编码型、编码-聚合型，在Bird-Bench Mini-Dev上进行系统性基准测试。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct上，讨论管道经三轮迭代提升执行准确率10.6%；Reasoner-Coder管道以DeepSeek-R1-32B和QwQ-32B为规划器，实现最高56.4%准确率。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM管道显著提升小模型的SQL生成性能，其中Reasoner-Coder管道表现最佳，使Gemma 3 27B IT的执行准确率提升至56.4%。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems provide a natural language interface that can enable even
laymen to access information stored in databases. However, existing Large
Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions
due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on
complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller,
efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent
LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small
to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents
iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final
answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates
stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3)
Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL
queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the
Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small
model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for
Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion. Among the pipelines,
the LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline yields the best results, with DeepSeek-R1-32B
and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT accuracy from 52.4% to the highest
score of 56.4%. Codes are available at

TL;DR: LAAC提出用LLM作为可信通信中介取代内容膨胀-压缩循环，但实验发现其在关键信任维度上仍存在缺口，尚未准备好用于高风险场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容导致通信虚浮，发送方与接收方均依赖LLM进行膨胀与压缩，丧失真实交流；LAAC旨在将LLM转变为可信的通信中介以恢复真实知识交换。

Method: 通过多智能体架构，在多个使用场景中进行受控实验，评估信息捕获保真度、可重复性和查询响应完整性三个维度。

Result: 初步实验揭示了LAAC在信息保真、一致性和可靠性三方面存在显著信任缺口。

Conclusion: LAAC作为通信中介的可信度存在可测量的差距，需在高风险通信场景中解决后方可可靠部署。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an absurd communication
theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content,
recipients use LLMs to compress them back into summaries, and as a consequence
neither party engage with authentic content. LAAC (LLM as a Communicator)
proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication
intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and
facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating
cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic
communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals,
professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying
LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about
information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper
systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment
across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental
dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction
during sender interviews across different communication types, (2)
Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple
interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of
recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or
fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,
we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.
Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before
LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.

TL;DR: LLM难以真实模拟人类语言，现有校准方法效果有限，需警惕其在社会模拟中的过度依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证依赖不可靠的人工判断，缺乏对LLM生成文本拟真度的量化评估工具，限制了其在社会科学中的可信应用。

Method: 提出计算图灵测试框架，结合BERT可检测性、语义相似性及语言风格特征，系统评估九个开源LLM在五个校准策略下对社交媒体文本的拟真能力。

Result: 所有校准后的LLM均无法完全模拟人类语言，指令微调模型表现劣于基础模型，情感与语义维度存在显著权衡。

Conclusion: LLM生成文本即使经过校准，仍与人类文本有明显差异，尤其在情感表达上；模型规模扩大并未提升拟真度，且拟真性与语义保真度存在权衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to
simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate
realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested.
Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --
testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence
that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks
robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating
models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we
introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates
aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with
interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to
assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.
Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration
strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval
-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly
Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the
literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable
from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.
Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up
model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:
optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and
vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for
validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note
about their current limitations in capturing human communication.

Motivation: 评估LLMs是否能通过波兰国家上诉法院的官方资格考试，探索其在法律裁决中的可行性。

Method: 构建混合信息检索与提取管道，在闭卷和检索增强生成设置下测试GPT-4.1、Claude 4 Sonnet和Bielik-11B-v2.6等模型，并采用'LLM作为法官'的自动评估方法。

Result: 模型在知识测试中表现良好，但在实践写作部分未达及格线；'LLM作为法官'的评估结果常与官方委员会判断不一致，存在幻觉、错误引用法律条文和逻辑论证薄弱等问题。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）尚不能替代人类法官或独立考官在波兰公共采购裁决中的角色。

Abstract: This study provides an empirical assessment of whether current large language
models (LLMs) can pass the official qualifying examination for membership in
Poland's National Appeal Chamber (Krajowa Izba Odwo{\l}awcza). The authors
examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the
'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically
evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which
includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a
written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction
pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4
Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various
Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the
models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing
threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the
'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining
committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to
hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical
argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and
technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological
progress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners
in Polish public procurement adjudication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法仅基于单个输入，可能忽略语义相似样本中的残留影响，导致隐私泄露风险，亟需更精细的评估手段。

Method: REMIND 通过分析模型对小输入变化的损失变化模式，检测未遗忘数据的残留影响，利用损失景观的平坦度区分有效遗忘与残留记忆。

Result: REMIND 仅需查询访问，优于现有方法，在不同模型、数据集和改写输入下均表现鲁棒，能有效识别未完全遗忘的数据。

Conclusion: REMIND 提供了一种更敏感和可解释的评估框架，用于衡量语言模型中的遗忘效果，为记忆与遗忘提供了新视角。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data
from a model without requiring full retraining. This capability is crucial for
ensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying
whether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining
reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often
assess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook
residual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can
compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND
(Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method
aiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify
whether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's
loss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point
evaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss
landscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile
patterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods
under similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models,
datasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world
deployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of
unlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess
unlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective
on memorization and unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管研究者不断改进预训练数据集，但缺乏对预训练机制提取知识效率的理解。

Method: 使用检索增强生成（RAG）和测试时计算，量化预训练过程中未提取的知识价值，并在不同规模下分析其变化。

Result: 在MMLU、Math-500和SimpleQA上，检索显著提升模型性能，MMLU上检索相当于5倍预训练计算量的增益，结合测试时解析可进一步提升10个百分点。

Conclusion: 当前预训练方法未能充分利用现有数据集中的信息，存在显著提升空间。

Abstract: Large language models learn from their vast pre-training corpora, gaining the
ability to solve an ever increasing variety of tasks; yet although researchers
work to improve these datasets, there is little effort to understand how
efficient the pre-training apparatus is at extracting ideas and knowledge from
the data. In this work, we use retrieval augmented generation along with
test-time compute as a way to quantify how much dataset value was left behind
by the process of pre-training, and how this changes across scale. We
demonstrate that pre-training then retrieving from standard and largely
open-sourced datasets results in significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500,
and SimpleQA, which persist through decontamination. For MMLU we observe that
retrieval acts as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone. We show
that these results can be further improved by leveraging additional compute at
test time to parse the retrieved context, demonstrating a 10 percentage point
improvement on MMLU for the public LLaMA 3.1 8B model. Overall, our results
suggest that today's pre-training methods do not make full use of the
information in existing pre-training datasets, leaving significant room for
progress.

Motivation: 现有主题建模方法虽高效，但生成的主题缺乏可解释性；而现有标签方法计算昂贵，亟需高效且可解释的替代方案。

Method: 提出一种基于图的轻量级方法，通过构建词间语义关系图并分析连接结构，为主题模型生成的词分布自动分配有意义的标签。

Result: 在两个数据集上，该方法在BERTScore和余弦相似度指标上优于传统基准，性能接近ChatGPT-3.5，且计算资源消耗显著更低。

Conclusion: 所提图基方法在保持计算高效的同时，实现了与ChatGPT-3.5相当的主题标签质量，优于传统基准方法。

Abstract: Extracting topics from text has become an essential task, especially with the
rapid growth of unstructured textual data. Most existing works rely on highly
computational methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we argue that
probabilistic and statistical approaches, such as topic modeling (TM), can
offer effective alternatives that require fewer computational resources. TM is
a statistical method that automatically discovers topics in large collections
of unlabeled text; however, it produces topics as distributions of
representative words, which often lack clear interpretability. Our objective is
to perform topic labeling by assigning meaningful labels to these sets of
words. To achieve this without relying on computationally expensive models, we
propose a graph-based approach that not only enriches topic words with
semantically related terms but also explores the relationships among them. By
analyzing these connections within the graph, we derive suitable labels that
accurately capture each topic's meaning. We present a comparative study between
our proposed method and several benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5, across two
different datasets. Our method achieved consistently better results than
traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity and produced
results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, while remaining computationally efficient.
Finally, we discuss future directions for topic labeling and highlight
potential research avenues for enhancing interpretability and automation.

Conclusion: SSPO通过句子级重要性比率平衡了GRPO和GSPO的优点，避免了训练崩溃和数据利用率低的问题，并在五个数据集上取得了SOTA性能。

Abstract: As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs),
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs'
reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative
Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are
observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,
respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,
which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected
by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation
of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high
variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO
importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common
importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,
leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a
decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which
applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and
GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also
prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping
mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily
adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and
narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves
an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and
GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These
results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking
the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为提升机器翻译模型的训练效果，解决数据质量参差不齐与低效使用的问题，需更智能地选择对微调最具贡献的数据样本。

Method: 通过定义可学习性评分，结合学习者模型与预训练参考模型，采用考虑数据点间相互依赖的批量选择策略进行数据筛选。

Result: 在CCMatrix数据集上，针对英波及其他语言对使用mBART模型，数据效率提升五倍，计算效率提升24倍，且翻译性能更优。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据选择方法显著提升了机器翻译模型的训练效率与翻译性能，优于随机选择基线。

Abstract: Data quality and its effective selection are fundamental to improving the
performance of machine translation models, serving as cornerstones for
achieving robust and reliable translation systems. This paper presents a data
selection methodology specifically designed for fine-tuning machine translation
systems, which leverages the synergy between a learner model and a pre-trained
reference model to enhance overall training effectiveness. By defining a
learnability score, our approach systematically evaluates the utility of data
points for training, ensuring that only the most relevant and impactful
examples contribute to the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, our method employs
a batch selection strategy which considers interdependencies among data points,
optimizing the efficiency of the training process while maintaining a focus on
data relevance. Experiments on English to Persian and several other language
pairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that
our method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared
to an iid baseline. Experimental results indicate that our approach improves
computational efficiency by 24 when utilizing cached embeddings, as it requires
fewer training data points. Additionally, it enhances generalization, resulting
in superior translation performance compared to random selection method.

Motivation: 评估LLM在历史语境下的时序推理能力，探索语言对模型表现的影响。

Method: 使用1940年挪威语 trivia 问题，以1940年视角 prompting 多个LLM（包括DeepSeek-R1、Gemma3、Qwen3、Llama3.1及专用挪威语模型），通过LLM-as-judge评分并抽样母语者验证。

Conclusion: 大型LLM显著提升时序推理性能，但英文提示优于挪威语提示，出乎意料。

Abstract: In this study, we experiment with the ability of LLMs to do temporal
reasoning. Using a Norwegian book from 1940 containing trivia questions, we
prompt the LLMs to answer the questions as if it were 1940. We also pose the
questions in both English and Norwegian. Correct answers are often presented as
sentences, and grading is done by means of LLM-as-judge, with sampled checks by
a native speaker. Prompting in English consistently gave better results than in
Norwegian, an unexpected result. In contrast, using larger LLMs improved
results. We tested the DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, and Llama3.1 model families,
and also the largest available LLM especially crafted for Norwegian.

Conclusion: PTTSD框架在仅使用文本数据的抑郁严重程度预测中实现了最先进的性能，并提供了具有良好校准性的预测区间，增强了临床决策的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential
for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty
estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time
Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from
utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD
includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining
bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or
Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC
and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only
systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated
prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and
probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality.
A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further
highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware
forecasting.

Motivation: Existing multimodal benchmarks heavily favor high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented, especially in document structure understanding tasks requiring fine-grained text recognition.

Method: Creation of a human-annotated benchmark with 2,808 samples across 13 task categories and zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source vision-language models.

Result: Proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro significantly outperform open-source models, with the largest performance drops observed in fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content extraction.

Conclusion: ThaiOCRBench provides a standardized framework for evaluating vision-language models on Thai text-rich tasks, revealing significant performance gaps and offering actionable insights for improving low-resource language understanding.

Abstract: We present ThaiOCRBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
vision-language models (VLMs) on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks.
Despite recent progress in multimodal modeling, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented,
especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding. ThaiOCRBench
addresses this gap by offering a diverse, human-annotated dataset comprising
2,808 samples across 13 task categories. We evaluate a wide range of
state-of-the-art VLMs in a zero-shot setting, spanning both proprietary and
open-source systems. Results show a significant performance gap, with
proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) outperforming open-source
counterparts. Notably, fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content
extraction exhibit the steepest performance drops among open-source models.
Through detailed error analysis, we identify key challenges such as language
bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content. ThaiOCRBench provides a
standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex
settings, and provides actionable insights for improving Thai-language document
understanding.

Motivation: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks are limited to small, uniform tables and fail to capture the complexity of real-world data, leading to an incomplete assessment of LLM reasoning abilities.

Method: Introducing RUST-BENCH, a benchmark with 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables in two domains (NSF grant records and NBA statistics), evaluating LLMs across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and multi-hop reasoning complexity.

Result: LLMs struggle significantly with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference over long, domain-specific tables.

Conclusion: RUST-BENCH reveals persistent weaknesses in current LLM architectures and prompting strategies for tabular reasoning, establishing a challenging new testbed for future research.

Abstract: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform
tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an
incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real
tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields
with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To
address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from
2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records)
and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates
LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning
complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs
struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing
persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies.

Abstract: This paper describes the OUNLP system submitted to the TSAR-2025 Shared Task
(Alva-Manchego et al., 2025), designed for readability-controlled text
simplification using LLM-prompting-based generation. Based on the analysis of
prompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding
that text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the
source CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by
this finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate
them via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based
LLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams.
Later improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified
candidates as the starting point could further boost the multi-round
simplification performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and responsibly manage personality-like behaviors in LLMs for human-centered applications.

Method: Applied Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework to evaluate six LLMs under varying sampling temperatures, using hierarchical clustering to identify trait patterns.

Result: Significant differences found in four of five personality dimensions; Neuroticism and Extraversion are highly sensitive to temperature, with clustering revealing architecturally influenced trait stability.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit personality-like traits that vary with sampling temperature and architectural design, influencing model tuning and ethical governance.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to human-centered
applications, understanding their personality-like behaviors is increasingly
important for responsible development and deployment. This paper systematically
evaluates six LLMs, applying the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework, to
assess trait expressions under varying sampling temperatures. We find
significant differences across four of the five personality dimensions, with
Neuroticism and Extraversion susceptible to temperature adjustments. Further,
hierarchical clustering reveals distinct model clusters, suggesting that
architectural features may predispose certain models toward stable trait
profiles. Taken together, these results offer new insights into the emergence
of personality-like patterns in LLMs and provide a new perspective on model
tuning, selection, and the ethical governance of AI systems. We share the data

Motivation: 现有方法无法有效处理放射学报告中的显性（如模糊措辞）和隐性（如遗漏推理）不确定性，限制了自动化分析的可靠性。

Method: 结合专家验证的LLM词句排序模型量化显性不确定性，并通过诊断路径扩展框架建模隐性不确定性。

Conclusion: 通过引入不确定性感知的Lunguage++基准，提升了放射学报告结构化分析的准确性与临床应用价值。

Abstract: Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great
potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.
These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct
types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of
findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on
the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of
uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when
radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or
diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent
or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part
framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,
LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding
to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit
uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds
characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for
14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded,
uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured
radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image
classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the
clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型生成文本时，单个词元选择可能导致截然不同的推理路径，使得不确定性难以量化，亟需理解模型是否隐式表示备选路径。

Method: 利用隐藏激活控制和预测语言模型在思维链推理中的不确定性，并分析激活与路径多样性的关联。

Result: 发现模型不确定性与激活干预效果显著相关，且隐藏激活能预测未来输出分布，表明模型隐式表征了可能的推理路径空间。

Conclusion: 语言模型在生成过程中通过隐藏激活表示潜在推理路径，激活干预在模型未确定最终答案时最有效。

Abstract: When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens
might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult
to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models
represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test
this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language
model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we
find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,
and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This
suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are
alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet
committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations
can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models
implicitly represent the space of possible paths.

Motivation: Existing automated essay scoring systems lack user-centric design and fail to provide interpretable insights into argumentative structure.

Method: Structures essays as argumentation graphs with LLM-generated classifications and visualizations, providing justifications and coherence metrics.

Result: IntelliProof enables rapid, interpretable analysis of argumentative quality with human oversight, supported by quantitative metrics and natural language explanations.

Conclusion: IntelliProof effectively bridges the gap between structural argumentation analysis and human understanding by combining LLM-based classification with interactive visualization.

Abstract: We present IntelliProof, an interactive system for analyzing argumentative
essays through LLMs. IntelliProof structures an essay as an argumentation
graph, where claims are represented as nodes, supporting evidence is attached
as node properties, and edges encode supporting or attacking relations. Unlike
existing automated essay scoring systems, IntelliProof emphasizes the user
experience: each relation is initially classified and scored by an LLM, then
visualized for enhanced understanding. The system provides justifications for
classifications and produces quantitative measures for essay coherence. It
enables rapid exploration of argumentative quality while retaining human
oversight. In addition, IntelliProof provides a set of tools for a better
understanding of an argumentative essay and its corresponding graph in natural

Motivation: 现有代码安全基准未能有效反映大语言模型生成漏洞的实际威胁，亟需一种更贴近真实场景的评估方法。

Method: 提出 Prompt Exposure (PE) 指标，综合评估漏洞严重性、生成概率和提示诱导强度，并据此定义 Model Exposure (ME) 分数以衡量模型生成漏洞的整体风险。

Conclusion: 当前主流开源大语言模型在真实使用场景中仍易生成高危代码漏洞，安全与功能之间的权衡阻碍了漏洞的有效修复。

Abstract: As the role of Large Language Models (LLM)-based coding assistants in
software development becomes more critical, so does the role of the bugs they
generate in the overall cybersecurity landscape. While a number of LLM code
security benchmarks have been proposed alongside approaches to improve the
security of generated code, it remains unclear to what extent they have
impacted widely used coding LLMs. Here, we show that even the latest
open-weight models are vulnerable in the earliest reported vulnerability
scenarios in a realistic use setting, suggesting that the safety-functionality
trade-off has until now prevented effective patching of vulnerabilities. To
help address this issue, we introduce a new severity metric that reflects the
risk posed by an LLM-generated vulnerability, accounting for vulnerability
severity, generation chance, and the formulation of the prompt that induces
vulnerable code generation - Prompt Exposure (PE). To encourage the mitigation
of the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities, we use PE to define the
Model Exposure (ME) score, which indicates the severity and prevalence of
vulnerabilities a model generates.

outperforms explanation-generating LLMs in efficiency, reducing runtime by 95%
on RAWFC (23 minutes 36 seconds compared to 454 minutes 12 seconds) and by 92%
on LIAR-RAW (134 minutes 14 seconds compared to 1692 minutes 23 seconds),

TL;DR: LOpInf outperforms other model reduction methods in controlling soft robot shape dynamics with lower tracking errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective dynamic shape control of soft robots is hindered by high-dimensional dynamics and lack of general-purpose modeling tools for control.

Method: Comparative study of three data-driven model reduction techniques: Eigensystem Realization Algorithm, Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control, and Lagrangian Operator Inference (LOpInf), applied to model predictive control.

Result: LOpInf-based control policies outperformed other methods in all three experiments: tracking feasible, biological, and physical reference trajectories.

Conclusion: Lagrangian Operator Inference (LOpInf) achieves the lowest tracking errors in dynamic shape control of a soft eel-inspired robot compared to other model reduction methods.

Abstract: Soft robots have shown immense promise in settings where they can leverage
dynamic control of their entire bodies. However, effective dynamic shape
control requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional
dynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for
modeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a
comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating
linear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three
methods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with
control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each
class of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies
for the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three
experiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be
feasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model
of eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a
reduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies
generated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models.

Conclusion: 所提出的统一强化学习控制器能够在真实环境中实现机器人对足球技能的高效、连贯和鲁棒的执行，显著优于传统解耦系统。

Abstract: Humanoid soccer poses a representative challenge for embodied intelligence,
requiring robots to operate within a tightly coupled perception-action loop.
However, existing systems typically rely on decoupled modules, resulting in
delayed responses and incoherent behaviors in dynamic environments, while
real-world perceptual limitations further exacerbate these issues. In this
work, we present a unified reinforcement learning-based controller that enables
humanoid robots to acquire reactive soccer skills through the direct
integration of visual perception and motion control. Our approach extends
Adversarial Motion Priors to perceptual settings in real-world dynamic
environments, bridging motion imitation and visually grounded dynamic control.
We introduce an encoder-decoder architecture combined with a virtual perception
system that models real-world visual characteristics, allowing the policy to
recover privileged states from imperfect observations and establish active
coordination between perception and action. The resulting controller
demonstrates strong reactivity, consistently executing coherent and robust
soccer behaviors across various scenarios, including real RoboCup matches.

TL;DR: 提出一种融合安全与操控性的上肢姿态优化方法，通过机器人引导与MPIC控制器显著改善人机协同搬运时的人体工效。

Abstract: This paper introduces an upper limb postural optimization method for
enhancing physical ergonomics and force manipulability during bimanual
human-robot co-carrying tasks. Existing research typically emphasizes human
safety or manipulative efficiency, whereas our proposed method uniquely
integrates both aspects to strengthen collaboration across diverse conditions
(e.g., different grasping postures of humans, and different shapes of objects).
Specifically, the joint angles of a simplified human skeleton model are
optimized by minimizing the cost function to prioritize safety and manipulative
capability. To guide humans towards the optimized posture, the reference
end-effector poses of the robot are generated through a transformation module.
A bimanual model predictive impedance controller (MPIC) is proposed for our
human-like robot, CURI, to recalibrate the end effector poses through planned
trajectories. The proposed method has been validated through various subjects
and objects during human-human collaboration (HHC) and human-robot
collaboration (HRC). The experimental results demonstrate significant
improvement in muscle conditions by comparing the activation of target muscles
before and after optimization.

Conclusion: LLMs能显著提升人-无人机群在高风险搜救任务中的协作效率，降低认知负荷，提高任务成功率和完成速度。

Abstract: Large-scale disaster Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are persistently
challenged by complex terrain and disrupted communications. While Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area
search and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a
significant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine
collaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an
error-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a
low-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,
this study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed
framework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and
multi-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It
then employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,
hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This
closed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,
providing active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual
monitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR
task. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and
command-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task
completion time by approximately $64.2\%$ and improved task success rate by
$7\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive
workload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\%$. This work establishes the
potential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm
collaborations in high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: Future planetary exploration missions demand high-performance, fault-tolerant
computing to enable autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) and
Lander Vision System (LVS) operations during Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL).
This paper evaluates the deployment of GNC and LVS algorithms on
next-generation multi-core processors--HPSC, Snapdragon VOXL2, and AMD Xilinx
Versal--demonstrating up to 15x speedup for LVS image processing and over 250x

optimization compared to legacy spaceflight hardware. To ensure computational
reliability, we present ARBITER (Asynchronous Redundant Behavior Inspection for

performs real-time fault detection and correction across redundant cores.
ARBITER is validated in both static optimization tasks (GFOLD) and dynamic
closed-loop control (Attitude Control System). A fault injection study further
identifies the gradient computation stage in GFOLD as the most sensitive to
bit-level errors, motivating selective protection strategies and vector-based
output arbitration. This work establishes a scalable and energy-efficient

Orbilander, and Ceres Sample Return, where onboard autonomy, low latency, and

Motivation: 现有方法要么仅限于仿真环境，要么专用于特定任务（如追踪），缺乏统一、通用且可提示的全身控制框架，难以在真实人形机器人上实现多任务泛化。

Method: 基于无监督强化学习与前向-后向（FB）模型构建共享潜在空间，嵌入运动、目标与奖励，并结合奖励塑造、领域随机化和历史依赖的非对称学习来弥合仿真到现实的差距。

Abstract: Building Behavioral Foundation Models (BFMs) for humanoid robots has the
potential to unify diverse control tasks under a single, promptable generalist
policy. However, existing approaches are either exclusively deployed on
simulated humanoid characters, or specialized to specific tasks such as
tracking. We propose BFM-Zero, a framework that learns an effective shared
latent representation that embeds motions, goals, and rewards into a common
space, enabling a single policy to be prompted for multiple downstream tasks
without retraining. This well-structured latent space in BFM-Zero enables
versatile and robust whole-body skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid in the real
world, via diverse inference methods, including zero-shot motion tracking, goal
reaching, and reward optimization, and few-shot optimization-based adaptation.
Unlike prior on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks, BFM-Zero builds
upon recent advancements in unsupervised RL and Forward-Backward (FB) models,
which offer an objective-centric, explainable, and smooth latent representation
of whole-body motions. We further extend BFM-Zero with critical reward shaping,
domain randomization, and history-dependent asymmetric learning to bridge the
sim-to-real gap. Those key design choices are quantitatively ablated in
simulation. A first-of-its-kind model, BFM-Zero establishes a step toward
scalable, promptable behavioral foundation models for whole-body humanoid
control.

Abstract: Existing Active SLAM methodologies face issues such as slow exploration speed
and suboptimal paths. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid
framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement
Learning framework and a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism. The
Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization framework jointly optimizes travel distance
and map uncertainty through a dual-objective reward function, balancing
exploration and exploitation. The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces
redundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update
Stagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental
results show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our
approach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up
to 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments
while maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the
collaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation
on a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical
applicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world
environments.

Conclusion: GraspView是一种无需深度传感器的RGB仅用机器人抓取系统，在复杂环境、遮挡、近场和透明物体场景下显著优于传统RGB-D和单视图RGB方法，是现实世界中可靠的替代方案。

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a fundamental capability for autonomous manipulation, yet
remains highly challenging in cluttered environments where occlusion, poor
perception quality, and inconsistent 3D reconstructions often lead to unstable
or failed grasps. Conventional pipelines have widely relied on RGB-D cameras to
provide geometric information, which fail on transparent or glossy objects and
degrade at close range. We present GraspView, an RGB-only robotic grasping
pipeline that achieves accurate manipulation in cluttered environments without
depth sensors. Our framework integrates three key components: (i) global
perception scene reconstruction, which provides locally consistent, up-to-scale
geometry from a single RGB view and fuses multi-view projections into a
coherent global 3D scene; (ii) a render-and-score active perception strategy,
which dynamically selects next-best-views to reveal occluded regions; and (iii)
an online metric alignment module that calibrates VGGT predictions against
robot kinematics to ensure physical scale consistency. Building on these
tailor-designed modules, GraspView performs best-view global grasping, fusing
multi-view reconstructions and leveraging GraspNet for robust execution.
Experiments on diverse tabletop objects demonstrate that GraspView
significantly outperforms both RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines, especially
under heavy occlusion, near-field sensing, and with transparent objects. These
results highlight GraspView as a practical and versatile alternative to RGB-D
pipelines, enabling reliable grasping in unstructured real-world environments.

Motivation: 仿真到现实的迁移存在动态差异问题，传统领域随机化虽能缓解但降低性能，因此探索通过条件化策略于动态参数估计来提升迁移效果。

Result: 在经典控制基准和真实机器人推物任务中，上下文感知策略表现更优，且最优监督策略因任务而异。

Conclusion: 上下文感知策略在所有设置中均优于无上下文的基线，但最佳监督策略依赖于具体任务。

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL)
for robotics, as policies trained in simulation often fail to generalize to the
real world due to discrepancies in environment dynamics. Domain Randomization
(DR) mitigates this issue by exposing the policy to a wide range of randomized
dynamics during training, yet leading to a reduction in performance. While
standard approaches typically train policies agnostic to these variations, we
investigate whether sim-to-real transfer can be improved by conditioning the
policy on an estimate of the dynamics parameters -- referred to as context. To
this end, we integrate a context estimation module into a DR-based RL framework
and systematically compare SOTA supervision strategies. We evaluate the
resulting context-aware policies in both a canonical control benchmark and a
real-world pushing task using a Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that
context-aware policies outperform the context-agnostic baseline across all
settings, although the best supervision strategy depends on the task.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A lighter, more efficient tailsitter UAV with reconfigurable wings and swashplateless control achieves stable, low-power flight in both multi-rotor and fixed-wing modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve wind disturbance resistance and power efficiency in multi-rotor mode while simplifying mechanical complexity of traditional tailsitter UAVs.

Method: Design of a reconfigurable wing system, coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor setup, and optimized swashplateless control mechanism with flapping hinges for reduced vibration and power consumption.

Result: Significant reduction in power consumption, lower structural weight, reduced vibration during transitions, and validated stable flight across the full flight envelope.

Conclusion: The proposed tailsitter UAV with reconfigurable wings, coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor configuration, and swashplateless mechanism demonstrates stable and efficient flight performance across all flight modes.

Abstract: The tailsitter vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAV is widely used due to
its lower dead weight, which eliminates the actuators and mechanisms for
tilting. However, the tailsitter UAV is susceptible to wind disturbances in
multi-rotor mode, as it exposes a large frontal fuselage area. To address this
issue, our tailsitter UAV features a reconfigurable wing design, allowing wings
to retract in multi-rotor mode and extend in fixed- wing mode. Considering
power efficiency, we design a coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor configuration,
which significantly re- duces the total power consumption. To reduce structural
weight and simplify structural complexity, we employ a swashplateless mechanism
with an improved design to control pitch and roll in multi-rotor mode. We
optimize the structure of the swashplateless mechanism by adding flapping
hinges, which reduces vibration during cyclic acceleration and deceleration.
Finally, we perform comprehensive transition flight tests to validate stable
flight performance across the entire flight envelope of the tailsitter UAV.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unknown environments requires compact yet expressive
spatial understanding under partial observability to support high-level

lightweight context encoder trained via multi-task self-supervised learning to
capture multi-scale, navigation-centric spatial representations; and (2) a
reinforcement learning policy that seamlessly integrates these representations
with graph-based reasoning for efficient action selection. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the context encoder's efficient and robust
environmental understanding. Real-world deployments further validate MacroNav's
effectiveness, yielding significant gains over state-of-the-art navigation
methods in both Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL),

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots that can learn new skills from demonstrations is
an important challenge of modern robotics. Existing solutions often apply
end-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or
symbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current
VLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which
hinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, symbolic
approaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this
paper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that
uses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic
representation of human demonstrations. This representation is used to generate
new planning domains during inference and serves as an orchestrator for
low-level VLA policies, scaling up the number of actions that can be reproduced
in a row. Our results show that GraSP-VLA is effective for modeling symbolic
representations on the task of automatic planning domain generation from
observations. In addition, results on real-world experiments show the potential
of our Continuous Scene Graph representation to orchestrate low-level VLA
policies in long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: ForeRobo通过生成式仿真与经典控制结合，实现了高效的零样本仿真到现实转移，并在多种操作任务中展现出卓越的泛化能力，平均成功率高达79.28%。

Abstract: Efficiently leveraging simulation to acquire advanced manipulation skills is
both challenging and highly significant. We introduce \textit{ForeRobo}, a
generative robotic agent that utilizes generative simulations to autonomously
acquire manipulation skills driven by envisioned goal states. Instead of
directly learning low-level policies, we advocate integrating generative
paradigms with classical control. Our approach equips a robotic agent with a
self-guided \textit{propose-generate-learn-actuate} cycle. The agent first
proposes the skills to be acquired and constructs the corresponding simulation
environments; it then configures objects into appropriate arrangements to
generate skill-consistent goal states (\textit{ForeGen}). Subsequently, the
virtually infinite data produced by ForeGen are used to train the proposed
state generation model (\textit{ForeFormer}), which establishes point-wise
correspondences by predicting the 3D goal position of every point in the
current state, based on the scene state and task instructions. Finally,
classical control algorithms are employed to drive the robot in real-world
environments to execute actions based on the envisioned goal states. Compared
with end-to-end policy learning methods, ForeFormer offers superior
interpretability and execution efficiency. We train and benchmark ForeFormer
across a variety of rigid-body and articulated-object manipulation tasks, and
observe an average improvement of 56.32\% over the state-of-the-art state
generation models, demonstrating strong generality across different
manipulation patterns. Moreover, in real-world evaluations involving more than
20 robotic tasks, ForeRobo achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and exhibits
remarkable generalization capabilities, attaining an average success rate of
79.28\%.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TAS improves action chunking in LfD by dynamically selecting optimal actions from cached chunks, boosting reactivity and performance without sacrificing consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing action chunking methods trade off reactivity for decision consistency, failing to achieve both; TAS aims to resolve this limitation.

Method: TAS caches predicted action chunks from multiple timesteps and uses a lightweight selector network to dynamically choose the optimal action.

Result: TAS achieves up to 73.3% absolute gain in success rates across diverse tasks and enhances RL training efficiency in simulation and physical robot experiments.

Conclusion: Temporal Action Selector (TAS) effectively balances reactivity, decision consistency, and motion coherence, significantly improving success rates and training efficiency in LfD.

Abstract: Action chunking is a widely adopted approach in Learning from Demonstration
(LfD). By modeling multi-step action chunks rather than single-step actions,
action chunking significantly enhances modeling capabilities for human expert
policies. However, the reduced decision frequency restricts the utilization of
recent observations, degrading reactivity - particularly evident in the
inadequate adaptation to sensor noise and dynamic environmental changes.
Existing efforts to address this issue have primarily resorted to trading off
reactivity against decision consistency, without achieving both. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel algorithm, Temporal Action Selector (TAS),
which caches predicted action chunks from multiple timesteps and dynamically
selects the optimal action through a lightweight selector network. TAS achieves
balanced optimization across three critical dimensions: reactivity, decision
consistency, and motion coherence. Experiments across multiple tasks with
diverse base policies show that TAS significantly improves success rates -
yielding an absolute gain of up to 73.3%. Furthermore, integrating TAS as a
base policy with residual reinforcement learning (RL) substantially enhances
training efficiency and elevates the performance plateau. Experiments in both
simulation and physical robots confirm the method's efficacy.

TL;DR: Evo-1 is a tiny, no-pretraining VLA model that beats bigger models in performance and efficiency, achieving 78% real-world success with only 0.77B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models are computationally expensive, rely on large-scale robot data pretraining, and suffer from degraded perceptual representations leading to overfitting and poor generalization.

Method: A lightweight Vision-Language-Action model built on a native VLM, incorporating a cross-modulated diffusion transformer and an optimized integration module, trained via a two-stage paradigm that preserves VLM representations.

Result: Evo-1 with only 0.77B parameters outperforms prior models by 12.4% on Meta-World, 6.9% on RoboTwin, and achieves 94.8% on LIBERO; real-world success rate of 78% with high inference speed and low memory usage.

Conclusion: Evo-1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple robotic benchmarks with lightweight design and no robot data pretraining, demonstrating superior efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful framework that
unifies perception, language, and control, enabling robots to perform diverse
tasks through multimodal understanding. However, current VLA models typically
contain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data
pretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as
limited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training
paradigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language
backbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks.
In this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces
computation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong
performance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native
multimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated
diffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together
forming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training
paradigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the
representations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite,
surpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also
attains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO. In real-world evaluations,
Evo-1 attains a 78% success rate with high inference frequency and low memory
overhead, outperforming all baseline methods. We release code, data, and model

TL;DR: 用VLMs理解驾驶意图，在语义层协调人机控制，大幅提高自动驾驶在复杂场景中的安全性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共享自主方法局限于低层轨迹仲裁，无法保留驾驶意图，导致在罕见或模糊场景中表现脆弱。

Method: 提出一种基于视觉语言模型（VLMs）的统一共享自主框架，通过多模态信息推断驾驶员意图并协调人机控制策略。

Result: 在模拟人设中实现完美召回与高准确率；人类调查中92%的仲裁结果被认同；在Bench2Drive基准上显著降低碰撞率并提升整体性能。

Conclusion: 在语义和语言层面进行仲裁是共享自主驾驶设计的关键原则，能有效保持与人类意图的一致性并提升系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain brittle in rare, ambiguous, and
out-of-distribution scenarios, where human driver succeed through contextual
reasoning. Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such
failures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain. However, most
existing methods restrict arbitration to low-level trajectories, which
represent only geometric paths and therefore fail to preserve the underlying
driving intent. We propose a unified shared autonomy framework that integrates
human input and autonomous planners at a higher level of abstraction. Our
method leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer driver intent from
multi-modal cues -- such as driver actions and environmental context -- and to
synthesize coherent strategies that mediate between human and autonomous
control. We first study the framework in a mock-human setting, where it
achieves perfect recall alongside high accuracy and precision. A human-subject
survey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with
arbitration outcomes in 92% of cases. Finally, evaluation on the Bench2Drive
benchmark demonstrates a substantial reduction in collision rate and
improvement in overall performance compared to pure autonomy. Arbitration at
the level of semantic, language-based representations emerges as a design
principle for shared autonomy, enabling systems to exercise common-sense
reasoning and maintain continuity with human intent.

Method: 基于真实世界视频构建软体数字孪生，并使用3D高斯泼溅技术实现机器人、物体和环境的逼真渲染。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies are advancing rapidly, but their direct
evaluation in the real world remains costly, time-consuming, and difficult to
reproduce, particularly for tasks involving deformable objects. Simulation
provides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often
fail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body
interactions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that
constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots,
objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian
Splatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation
tasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing,
demonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world
execution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies.
Our results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with
high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation
of robotic manipulation policies. Website: https://real2sim-eval.github.io/

TL;DR: X-Diffusion利用扩散过程模糊人类与机器人动作的执行差异，仅在高层语义保留时引入人类数据，显著提升机器人学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类视频数据丰富但动作执行与机器人存在物理不匹配，直接重定向会导致不可行动作，需一种方法在保留高层语义的同时消除执行差异。

Method: 提出X-Diffusion框架，通过训练分类器区分人类与机器人动作，并在扩散过程中仅当动作无法被识别来源时才引入人类数据，结合机器人动作进行精细去噪指导。

Result: 在五个操作任务中，X-Diffusion比最佳基线平均成功率提高16%，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: X-Diffusion显著提升机器人在操作任务中的成功率，通过利用扩散过程保留高层任务指导而忽略低层执行差异，有效利用人类演示数据。

Abstract: Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing
source of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ
fundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct
kinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that
are physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,
human demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and
interact with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion
process: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade
while high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a
principled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages
human data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first
trains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or
robot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after
adding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.
Actions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low
noise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at
higher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under
execution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion
consistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves
a 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website
is available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.

TL;DR: GentleHumanoid通过全身阻抗控制实现人形机器人自然柔顺交互，在保持任务成功的同时显著降低接触力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习策略过于强调刚性跟踪，抑制外部力；现有阻抗方法局限于基座或末端控制，且仅应对极端力，缺乏自然柔顺交互能力。

Method: 将基于弹簧的阻抗控制整合到全身运动跟踪策略中，统一建模抵抗性接触和引导性接触，并通过任务可调力阈值增强安全性。

Result: 在仿真和Unitree G1人形机器人上验证，GentleHumanoid在拥抱、坐站辅助和物体操作等任务中均实现更小的峰值接触力与更自然的交互。

Conclusion: GentleHumanoid框架显著降低了接触力峰值，同时保持任务成功率，推动了人形机器人在真实环境中安全协作的能力。

Abstract: Humanoid robots are expected to operate in human-centered environments where
safe and natural physical interaction is essential. However, most recent
reinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress
external forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically
restricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme
forces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a
framework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking
policy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based
formulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing
against surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human
motion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across
the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse
interaction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable
force thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the
Unitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,
including gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object
manipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak
contact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more
natural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots
that can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in
real-world environments.

TL;DR: DreamGym enables scalable RL for LLM agents by generating synthetic experiences via reasoning, outperforming baselines and reducing reliance on costly real-world interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical RL for LLM agents is hindered by costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable rewards, and infrastructure complexity, which impede scalable experience collection.

Method: DreamGym synthesizes diverse, scalable experiences via a reasoning-based experience model that simulates state transitions and feedback, augmented with an offline-initialized experience replay buffer and adaptive task generation for curriculum learning.

Result: DreamGym achieves over 30% improvement on WebArena, matches GRPO/PPO performance using only synthetic data, and enables effective sim-to-real transfer with far fewer real-world interactions.

Conclusion: DreamGym significantly improves RL training for LLM agents by enabling scalable synthetic experience generation, outperforming baselines on non-RL-ready tasks and matching state-of-the-art performance on RL-ready tasks with minimal real-world interactions.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

Motivation: 汇编代码的分词研究长期被忽视，而其对词汇规模、语义覆盖和下游任务性能有根本性影响。

Method: 系统评估多种NLP分词模型在汇编代码上的内在特性（如词汇压缩率、表示保真度）及其在函数签名预测等下游任务中的表现，结合Llama 3.2、BERT和BART等模型进行实验。

Result: 分词选择显著影响下游任务性能，内在指标仅部分预测外在表现，揭示了内在属性与实际应用间的复杂权衡。

Conclusion: 优化低级代码分析的分词模型能提升基于自然语言模型的二进制分析流程的鲁棒性与可扩展性。

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic

TL;DR: DKT 不是靠双向关系，而是靠捕捉知识间的因果链来预测学生表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战现有观点——DKT 的性能提升源于建模 KC 间的双向关系，提出其真实机制是建模因果结构。

Method: 通过将练习关系图修剪为有向无环图（DAG），并在 Assistments 数据集的因果子集上训练 DKT，结合 DKT 学习表示提取 DAG 进行实证分析。

Result: DKT 在因果结构子集上表现优异，且其学习表示可有效提取因果 DAG，支持因果依赖是其核心机制的结论。

Conclusion: DKT 的有效性主要源于其近似知识组件（KC）之间的因果依赖关系，而非双向关系。

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

TL;DR: LLM能响应文化提示，但被少数国家价值观锚定，无法真正代表全球文化多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM训练数据与优化目标存在显著不平衡，引发对其能否反映全球用户文化多样性的质疑，亟需系统研究文化因素对模型输出的影响。

Method: 使用11种语言翻译霍夫斯泰德价值观调查模块和世界价值观调查的63个项目，对10个LLM进行提示测试，比较不同语言提示与文化框架下模型输出的差异。

Result: 提示语言和文化框架均影响模型输出，但文化框架比语言更有效；联合使用两者无额外增益；所有模型均表现出对特定国家价值观的系统性偏倚，并倾向于在社会宽容等议题上采取进步立场。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型虽然对提示语言和文化框架有响应，但其输出仍固着于少数国家（如荷兰、德国、美国、日本）的文化默认值，无法充分代表全球文化多样性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统性地研究了多智能体AI系统中的异常检测问题，提供了数据集、基准和见解以指导未来研究。

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,

Motivation: 尽管行为研究已发现LLMs在数值推理中的错误，但其内部表征机制尚不明确，亟需探究多数值属性的整合机制及无关上下文的影响。

Method: 结合线性探测、偏相关分析和基于提示的脆弱性测试，跨不同规模模型进行实验。

Result: LLMs编码真实世界数值关联但系统性放大；无关上下文导致幅度表征一致偏移，且下游影响随模型规模变化。

Conclusion: LLMs存在多属性数值表征的系统性放大和无关上下文干扰的脆弱性，为实现公平、感知表征的控制提供了基础。

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

Conclusion: LLM-KGFR框架在保持可扩展性和泛化能力的同时，实现了强大的知识图谱增强推理性能，为KG增强推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are
limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs.
We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for
KG-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: Voice AI agents are rapidly transitioning to production deployments, yet
systematic methods for ensuring testing reliability remain underdeveloped.
Organizations cannot objectively assess whether their testing approaches
(internal tools or external platforms) actually work, creating a critical
measurement gap as voice AI scales to billions of daily interactions.
  We present the first systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing
quality through human-centered benchmarking. Our methodology addresses the
fundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test
conversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses
(evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric
techniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence
intervals, and permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to
provide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach.
  To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted
comprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms
focused on Voice AI Testing using 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations
and ground truth validation on 60 conversations. Results reveal statistically
significant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the
top-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as
f1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league
based scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms.
  This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate
the testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement
foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale. Supporting materials
are made available to facilitate reproducibility and adoption.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and

likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

TL;DR: 通过预测编码与信息瓶颈，多智能体在极低带宽下自组织出高效社交通信机制，成功实现类生物的集体智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中由于部分可观测性和带宽限制导致的协调失效问题，探索如何在资源受限下形成有效的社交表征。

Method: 提出一种多智能体预测编码框架，基于信息瓶颈目标，结合类网格细胞的空间编码与层次强化学习策略，实现自监督运动预测与带宽高效通信。

Result: 在Memory-Maze基准上，当带宽从128降至4 bit/step时，成功率仅从73.5%降至64.4%，远优于全广播基线的67.6%→28.6%；并自发涌现出类海马体社交位置细胞的神经表征。

Conclusion: 该框架为多智能体系统提供了一种理论严谨且生物 plausible 的社交表征涌现机制，实现了在低带宽下仍能保持高协调成功率的集体智能。

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

TL;DR: RLoop通过迭代探索与微调，将训练中的策略多样性转化为稳定性能提升，显著改善RLVR模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在训练过程中因丢弃中间策略多样性导致过专门化与遗忘，损害模型泛化能力。

Method: RLoop框架结合强化学习探索与拒绝采样微调（RFT），通过迭代循环利用成功轨迹构建专家数据集，持续优化初始策略。

Result: 相比标准RL，RLoop平均准确率提升9%，pass@32提升超15%。

Conclusion: RLoop通过迭代策略初始化有效缓解了强化学习中的过拟合和灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

*Jacob Lysnæs-Larsen,Marte Eggen,Inga Strümke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 高探针准确率不等于好概念表示，需用空间对齐和新指标评估，避免虚假相关性误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAV方法依赖探针准确率作为概念代表性的标准，但实际探针易捕捉虚假相关性而非目标概念，导致概念对齐不可靠。

Method: 提出基于空间线性归因的概念定位方法，并与现有特征可视化技术对比；引入三类量化概念对齐的指标：硬准确率、分割得分和增强鲁棒性。

Result: 故意构造的虚假对齐探针可达到与标准探针相近的准确率，而空间对齐和翻译不变性显著提升概念对齐度，证明需摒弃单纯准确率评估。

Conclusion: 探针的分类准确率不能可靠衡量概念对齐度，应使用基于对齐的评估指标，如硬准确率、分割得分和增强鲁棒性，并设计与模型架构及概念特性相匹配的探针。

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

Conclusion: AdversariaLLM 建立了一个透明、可比较和可复现的LLM安全研究基础。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and
robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of
implementations, datasets, and evaluation methods. This fragmentation makes
reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering
meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a
toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on
reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements
twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets
spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access
to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation
includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as
compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation
techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package
JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim
to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible
research in LLM safety.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏真实世界数据，隐私与访问限制制约了LLM药物安全性评估，且在真实临床咨询场景中的安全性评估尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建模拟临床咨询框架，生成包含药物风险的问诊对话，建立RxRisk DB数据库（含6,725项禁忌、28,781项药物相互作用等），并通过两阶段过滤构建RxSafeBench基准（2,443个高质量场景），采用结构化多选题评估LLM能力。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在药物安全性评估中表现不佳，尤其在处理隐性风险时，亟需通过提示优化和任务特定微调提升可靠性；RxSafeBench为首个全面评估LLM药物安全性的基准，推动更安全的AI临床决策支持系统发展。

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

TL;DR: 为解决生成-验证架构中缺乏监控导致的推理偏差，本文提出MGV框架，首次将元认知理论计算化，为未来推理系统设计提供理论工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成-验证架构忽略推理前的监控过程，导致模型过早锁定次优路径，造成约20%的准确率损失。

Method: 将Flavell与Nelson和Narens的元认知理论形式化为计算规范，提出Monitor-Generate-Verify（MGV）框架，扩展了传统的Generate-Verify范式。

Result: 提出了MGV框架，通过引入生成前的元认知监控与验证反馈的迭代优化，弥补了推理架构中的关键缺失环节。

Conclusion: 该论文首次系统性地将元认知理论转化为计算框架，为测试时推理架构的设计提供了理论基础和干预方向。

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

TL;DR: 用自生成低后悔轨迹微调LLM，无需人工提示，大幅提升其在线决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型原非为决策设计，在线决策中常表现不佳，难以实现低后悔与探索-利用平衡。

Method: 通过迭代式后悔最小化微调，模型自生成低后悔决策轨迹并自我微调，避免依赖人工设计的提示或外部算法。

Result: 在多种模型（包括Transformer、开源与闭源LLM）上验证，Iterative RMFT 在不同任务维度（时域、动作空间、奖励机制）上均显著提升决策性能，并具备理论支持。

Conclusion: Iterative RMFT 提供了一种原则性且通用的后训练框架，显著提升了大语言模型在决策任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as "agents" for
decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they
were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle
even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective
exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative
Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure
that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base
model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,
selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior
methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely
on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the
regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.
This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and
provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results
show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -
from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and
advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and
reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,
action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we
provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this
paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,
Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for
enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.

*Anisha Garg,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRPO改进了GRPO在序数奖励下的缺陷，通过自适应基线避免强化错误行为，实现更优的LLM强化学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO因过于简化，在使用非二元序数奖励时会错误地正向强化失败轨迹，限制了LLM从 richer 反馈中学习的能力。

Method: 提出Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO)，采用自适应基线：先确保最低质量阈值以避免强化失败轨迹，待策略稳定后切换至相对偏好模式以优化最优解。

Result: 在代码验证任务上，CoRPO相比GRPO表现出更稳定的收敛性和更强的出域泛化性能。

Conclusion: CoRPO通过自适应基线机制有效解决了GRPO在序数奖励下强化错误行为的问题，实现了更稳定的收敛和更好的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在医疗、教育和法律等领域的决策模拟及人类行为仿真中，其与真实人类决策的对齐程度尚不明确，可能导致实际应用中的有害结果或仿真失效。

Method: 开发了博弈论实验的数字孪生系统，并引入了系统的提示与探测框架，对Llama、Mistral和Qwen三个开源模型进行机器行为评估。

Result: Llama模型高保真地再现了人类合作模式，捕捉到人类对理性选择理论的偏离；Qwen则与纳什均衡预测高度一致；无需基于人格的提示即可实现群体层面的行为复制，并生成了超出原始实验参数范围的新假设。

Conclusion: 适当校准的大型语言模型可以复制人类群体行为模式，并为社会科学提供一种生成新经验预测的补充方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

Motivation: To ensure trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific progress by understanding current capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems while preserving academic integrity.

Method: The system mimics a novice researcher's workflow—analyzing baseline papers, formulating hypotheses, conducting multi-file experiments, and writing papers—using modern coding agents and is evaluated via AI reviewers, author assessments, and submission to Agents4Science.

Result: Jr. AI Scientist achieves higher review scores than prior systems, yet faces critical limitations in reliability, reproducibility, and scientific rigor as identified by human evaluators and peer reviews.

Conclusion: Jr. AI Scientist demonstrates superior performance over existing automated systems but reveals significant risks and limitations that must be addressed for safe deployment.

Abstract: Understanding the current capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems is
essential for ensuring trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific
progress while preserving the integrity of the academic ecosystem. To this end,
we develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system
that mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given
the baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,
formulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous
experimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous
approaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI
Scientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding
agents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically
valuable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments
using AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,
a venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings
demonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review
scores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify
important limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science
reviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI
Scientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we
comprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope
these insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI
Scientist development.

Method: 提出一个区分协作查询与非协作查询的原理性框架，并对15个流行数据集中的查询进行分析。

Result: 发现现有数据集中查询类型混杂，阻碍了系统能力的精准评估；提出应转向以协作为核心的接口设计与评估范式。

Conclusion: 通过将歧义重新定义为协作交互的特征，而非缺陷，本研究为表格数据的自然语言接口提供了更合理的评估与设计框架。

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

Conclusion: 集成审计框架的在线平台可有效提升审议过程中的代表性，LLMs虽具潜力但仍存在局限性。

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

Result: 在协作推块任务中，DR. WELL使智能体能跨情境自适应，动态世界模型捕获可复用模式，提升任务完成率与效率。

Conclusion: DR. WELL通过符号规划和动态世界模型，显著提升了多智能体协作的任务完成率和效率，尽管有时间开销，但实现了更高效的协作策略演化。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

TL;DR: VeriCoT makes LLM reasoning trustworthy by turning thoughts into checkable logic and using it to fix errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce correct answers through flawed reasoning, which undermines trust in high-stakes applications; there is a need for reliable self-verification of logical steps.

Method: VeriCoT converts CoT reasoning into first-order logic, grounds premises in context or knowledge, and uses automated solvers for verification, combined with inference-time reflection and fine-tuning methods (SFT/PFT-DPO).

Result: VeriCoT effectively detects flawed reasoning on ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets, predicts answer correctness, and improves model performance via verification-guided fine-tuning.

Conclusion: VeriCoT improves reasoning reliability in LLMs by formalizing and verifying Chain-of-Thought steps with symbolic logic, leading to higher accuracy and trustworthiness.

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.
